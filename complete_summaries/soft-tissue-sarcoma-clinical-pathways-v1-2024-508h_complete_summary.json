This clinical pathway provides a systematic approach to diagnosis, staging, treatment, and follow-up for various sarcoma subtypes. Key principles include:\n\n1. Expert pathology review is recommended for all sarcoma diagnoses\n2. Multidisciplinary team consultation is essential for optimal management\n3. Clinical trials should be considered throughout treatment (contact: CancerClinicalTrialsNavigation@va.gov)\n4. Treatment decisions should incorporate patient preferences through shared decision-making\n\n## General Diagnostic Approach\n\n### Initial Diagnostic Workup\n- Appropriate imaging of primary tumor (MRI preferred for extremity locations; CT for thoracic/abdominal)\n- Core needle biopsy with carefully planned needle track along future resection axis\n- Minimal dissection and careful attention to hemostasis during biopsy\n\n### Staging Evaluation\n- CT chest with contrast to evaluate for pulmonary metastases\n- Additional imaging as clinically indicated based on primary site\n\n### Molecular and Genetic Testing\n- Recommended: Somatic Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)\n- DNA and RNA-based Comprehensive Genomic Profiling (CGP)\n- Specimen collection: tumor tissue or blood\n- Recommended platforms: Tempus or Foundation Medicine (Heme panel)\n\n## Specific Sarcoma Subtypes and Management\n\n### Kaposi Sarcoma\n\n#### Initial Assessment\n- Determine if limited cutaneous disease or more extensive\n- For HIV-positive patients: Initiate antiretroviral therapy first and monitor response\n\n#### Limited Cutaneous Disease Management\n- Expert pathology review and sarcoma team consultation\n- Multidisciplinary discussion for referral to: Radiation Oncology, Interventional Radiology, Surgery, or topical/intralesional therapies\n\n#### Systemic Therapy Decision Tree\n- **Cardiac function assessment**:\n  -

SURVEILLANCE PROTOCOLS\n\nSurveillance protocols vary by sarcoma subtype and stage, but generally include:\n\n#### A. GENERAL PRINCIPLES\n- Regular clinical assessment with history and physical examination\n- Imaging of primary tumor site\n- CT chest for pulmonary metastasis detection\n- Frequency typically every 3-6 months for first 2-3 years, then less frequently\n\n#### B. SUBTYPE-SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS\n\n**1. Extremity, Body Wall, or Head/Neck Sarcoma**:\n   - History and physical examination\n   - CT chest\n   - Imaging of primary tumor location\n   - Every 3-6 months for 3 years, then annually\n\n**2. Phyllodes Tumors**:\n   - For patients <30 years: Ultrasound every 6 months for 2 years, then annually for 3 years\n   - For other patients: Ultrasound alternating with mammogram every 6 months for 3 years, then annually for 5 years\n   - For mastectomy patients: Clinical exam every 6 months\n\n**3. Desmoid Tumors**:\n   - Imaging every 3-6 months\n   - More frequent monitoring for symptomatic patients\n\n**4. Rhabdomyosarcoma**:\n   - CT of lungs and anatomic location of tumor\n   - Every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months, then annually for 3-5 years\n\n**5. Uterine Sarcoma**:\n   - Imaging (CT CAP with IV contrast)\n   - Physical exam including pelvic exam\n   - Schedule varies by stage and treatment response\n\n**6. Cardiac Monitoring for Anthracycline Therapy**:\n   - Baseline echocardiogram before starting doxorubicin\n   - Continue monitoring with echocardiogram every 3 months during treatment\n   - Adequate cardiac function defined as ejection fraction >55% or <10% drop from prior echocardiogram\n\n### VI. SPECIAL CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n#### A. RADIATION THERAPY\n- Preoperative radiation preferred over postoperative for extremity sarcomas\n- Adjuvant radiation for high-grade tumors following R1 and R2 resection\n- EBRT/IMRT/VMAT preferred techniques when expertise available\n\n#### B. SYSTEMIC THERAPY CONSIDERATIONS\n- Ifosfamide requires assessment of patient age, co-morbidities, tolerability, and risk for neurotoxicity/hemorrhagic cystitis\n- Post-operative anthracycline-based chemotherapy indicated for:\n  * High-grade tumors\n  * Specific histologies (Osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma, Synovial Sarcoma)\n  * Tumors >10 cm\n\n#### C. SURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n- For phyllodes tumors: Surgical margins should be no more than 1 mm\n- Negative margin not required for benign phyllodes\n\n#### D. SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n- Kaposi Sarcoma related to transplant requires treatment with sirolimus\n- For tumors located in intra-abdominal or abdominal wall, refer to Germline Testing pathway for Gardner Syndrome/FAP evaluation\n\n#### E. VA PRESUMPTIVE CONDITIONS\nSoft tissue sarcoma is considered a presumptive condition for:\n- Vietnam Veterans (excluding osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and mesothelioma)\n- Atomic Veterans exposed to ionizing radiation\n- Gulf War and Post 9/11 Veterans serving in specific locations (for head, neck, and reproductive cancers)\n\nNow I'll organize all this information into a comprehensive clinical pathway document that can serve as a definitive reference for healthcare providers."
