Clinical trials should always be considered within all treatment pathways.\n2. For assistance finding a clinical trial, email CancerClinicalTrialsNavigation@va.gov.\n3. Evidence base for targeted therapies in recurrent/metastatic disease is limited, primarily from phase 2 clinical trials.\n4. Management decisions should involve shared decision-making with patients, particularly when multiple treatment options exist.\n5. For adenoid cystic histology, consider long-term surveillance beyond the standard 5 years.\n\nNow, I'll compile this information into a well-structured, comprehensive clinical pathway summary suitable for healthcare providers."
