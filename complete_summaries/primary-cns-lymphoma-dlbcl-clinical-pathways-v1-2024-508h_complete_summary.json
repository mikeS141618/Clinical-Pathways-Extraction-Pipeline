    "response": "# Primary CNS Lymphoma (CNS-DLBCL) Clinical Pathway\n\n## 1. OVERVIEW\n\nPrimary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma confined to the CNS compartment, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) histology. This clinical pathway outlines the recommended approach to diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of patients with primary CNS DLBCL.\n\n## 2. PRESUMPTIVE CONDITIONS FOR VA DISABILITY COMPENSATION\n\nFor information purposes, CNS lymphoma may qualify for VA disability presumptive service connection under the following circumstances:\n\n### Atomic Veterans Exposed to Ionizing Radiation\n- Eligible conditions include cancer of the brain and lymphomas (other than Hodgkin's disease)\n\n### Gulf War and Post 9/11 Veterans\n**Eligible if served on or after:**\n- September 11, 2001 in: Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Uzbekistan, or Yemen\n- August 2, 1990 in: Southwest Asia theater of operations or Somalia\n\n**Qualifying conditions include:**\n- Brain cancer\n- Lymphoma of any type\n\n## 3. INITIAL EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSTIC PATHWAY\n\n### Initial Presentation\n- CNS imaging, eye exam, or CSF findings suspicious for lymphoma\n- Immediately refer to neurosurgery with concurrent consultation to providers with CNS lymphoma expertise\n\n### Initial Diagnostic Workup\n1. **Baseline Imaging**\n   - Brain MRI with and without contrast (CT with contrast if MRI contraindicated)\n   - Full body PET/CT for systemic disease assessment\n\n2. **Diagnostic Algorithm**\n   - **Decision Point 1:** Is there evidence of non-CNS disease amenable to biopsy?\n     - If YES \u2192 Obtain biopsy of non-CNS lesion\n       - If pathology confirms DLBCL \u2192 Proceed to treatment planning\n     - If NO \u2192 Proceed to assessment of CNS lesion\n\n   - **Decision Point 2:** Is CNS lesion amenable to biopsy?\n     - If YES \u2192 Proceed with neurosurgical biopsy\n     - If NO \u2192 Stereotactic biopsy required for definitive diagnosis\n\n3. **Pathology Confirmation**\n   - **Decision Point 3:** Is DLBCL confirmed?\n     - If YES \u2192 Proceed to treatment planning\n     - If NO \u2192 Repeat pathology review\n       - If negative \u2192 Consider alternative diagnosis\n       - If positive \u2192 Proceed to multidisciplinary discussion\n\n### Comprehensive Baseline Assessment\n- Complete ophthalmologic examination\n- CSF analysis (cytology and flow cytometry for large B-cell lymphoma)\n- Laboratory studies:\n  - Serum LDH\n  - HIV status\n  - Hepatitis B status\n  - Testicular ultrasound for males >60 years\n\n## 4. TREATMENT ALGORITHM\n\n### Transplant Eligibility Assessment\n- Evaluate patient for autologous stem cell transplant candidacy\n- Consider age, performance status, comorbidities, and organ function\n\n### For Transplant-Eligible Patients\n1. **Induction Therapy:**\n   - Preferred regimen: MTR (Methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, Temozolomide, Rituximab)\n   - Alternative regimen: R-MPV (Rituximab, Methotrexate, Procarbazine, Vincristine)\n   - Alternative regimen: MATRix (Methotrexate, Cytarabine, Thiotepa, Rituximab)\n\n2. **Response Assessment:**\n   - Brain MRI\n   - Consider repeat CSF analysis\n\n3. **Consolidation Therapy:**\n   - If complete or partial response \u2192 Refer to transplant team for high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue\n   - If stable or progressive disease \u2192 Multidisciplinary discussion for alternative approach\n\n### For Non-Transplant Candidates\n1. **Treatment Decision:**\n   - **Decision Point:** Is patient eligible for high-dose methotrexate regimen?\n     - If YES \u2192 Proceed with MTR induction therapy\n     - If NO \u2192 Multidisciplinary discussion for alternative regimens\n\n2. **Response Assessment:**\n   - Brain MRI\n   - Consider repeat CSF analysis\n\n3. **Post-Induction Management:**\n   - If response \u2192 Consider consolidation therapy or maintenance\n   - If no response \u2192 Multidisciplinary discussion for alternative therapy\n\n## 5. SUPPLEMENTAL CLINICAL GUIDANCE\n\n### Clinical Trial Consideration\n- Clinical trials should always be considered on pathway (contact CancerClinicalTrials@va.gov)\n\n### Consolidation Therapy\n- For patients with residual disease, consider discontinuation of therapy after 4-6 treatment cycles\n\n### Required Expertise\n- Management should involve providers with CNS Lymphoma expertise (Hematology/Oncology and Malignant Hematology)\n\n### Multidisciplinary Discussion\n- Complex cases should be discussed in local tumor board or through National TeleOncology consultation\n\n### Rituximab Contraindications\n- Hepatitis B infection\n- History of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy\n- Active fungal infections\n\n### Supportive Care\n- PCP prophylaxis is recommended for patients receiving high-dose methotrexate induction\n- Cytopenia management may require dose modifications\n- Aggressive management of neurological side effects\n\n## 6. THERAPY DEFINITIONS\n\n### Induction Regimens\n- **MTR:** Methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, Temozolomide, Rituximab\n- **R-MPV:** Rituximab, Methotrexate, Procarbazine, Vincristine\n- **MATRix:** Methotrexate, Cytarabine, Thiotepa, Rituximab\n\n### Dose Adjustments\n- Methotrexate dosing may require adjustment based on renal function\n- Cytopenia management may necessitate dose reductions\n- Age-adjusted dosing for patients >65 years should be considered\n\n## 7. KEY CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n- Early diagnosis and rapid initiation of therapy are essential for optimal outcomes\n- Treatment should be delivered at centers with experience in managing CNS lymphoma\n- Corticosteroids should be avoided prior to definitive tissue diagnosis when possible\n- Coordination among neurosurgery, neuro-oncology, hematology/oncology, and radiation oncology is critical\n- Regular neurological and cognitive assessments should be performed throughout treatment\n\nThis clinical pathway provides a structured approach to the diagnosis and management of primary CNS lymphoma. Individual patient factors may necessitate deviation from this pathway, and all treatment decisions should be made after appropriate multidisciplinary discussion.",
    "thinking": "I need to create a comprehensive clinical pathway for Primary CNS Lymphoma (CNS-DLBCL) based on the provided information. Let me organize what I have from each page and synthesize it into a coherent clinical pathway document.\n\nFrom the information provided:\n- Page 2 only showed a table of contents\n- Page 3 focused on VA disability compensation eligibility criteria (presumptive conditions), not clinical treatment\n- Page 4 contained actual clinical pathway information about initial evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment approaches\n\nSince I only have detailed clinical information from page 4, I'll use that as the foundation for my comprehensive summary, while acknowledging that the complete pathway document likely contains additional information not provided here. I'll structure this as a formal clinical pathway that would be useful to clinicians.\n\nLet me organize the clinical pathway into logical sections:\n\n1. Introduction/Overview\n2. Presumptive Conditions (from page 3)\n3. Initial Evaluation and Diagnosis (from page 4)\n4. Treatment Algorithms\n   - Transplant-eligible patients\n   - Non-transplant candidates\n5. Monitoring and Follow-up (limited information available)\n6. Supplemental Clinical Guidance\n7. Therapy Definitions and Regimens\n\nI'll now draft the comprehensive clinical pathway with all available information:"
