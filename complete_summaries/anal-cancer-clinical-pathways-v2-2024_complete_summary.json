    "thinking": "I'll create a comprehensive summary of the anal cancer clinical pathway based on the analyses of multiple pages provided. Let me organize the information into a logical, clinically relevant structure that captures all the key decision points, diagnostic criteria, treatment options, and clinical workflows.\n\n# Comprehensive Summary of Anal Cancer Clinical Pathway\n\n## 1. Introduction and Scope\nThe anal cancer clinical pathway provides a systematic approach to the diagnosis, staging, and management of anal and perianal carcinoma. It includes guidance for various disease presentations, including localized disease amenable to local excision, locoregional disease not amenable to complete local excision, and metastatic disease.\n\n## 2.
