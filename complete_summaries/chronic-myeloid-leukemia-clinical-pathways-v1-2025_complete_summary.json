    "response": "# COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL PATHWAY: CHRONIC MYELOID LEUKEMIA (CML)\n\n## 1. INTRODUCTION AND DISEASE OVERVIEW\n\nChronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome\u2014a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 [t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)]\u2014resulting in the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. This fusion produces a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that drives disease pathogenesis. Management focuses on tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy with structured response assessment and monitoring.\n\n## 2. DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH\n\n### 2.1 Initial Diagnostic Workup\nWhen CML is suspected, perform:\n- FISH analysis for t(9;22) BCR-ABL1 using bone marrow or peripheral blood\n- Bone marrow karyotyping\n- Quantitative PCR for BCR-ABL1 transcripts\n\n### 2.2 Specimen Considerations\n- While peripheral blood can be used for initial molecular testing, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are recommended for:\n  - Phase classification (chronic, accelerated, or blast)\n  - Complete karyotype analysis\n  - Cases with unusual peripheral blood findings\n  - When adequate cellular aspirate cannot be obtained\n\n## 3. DISEASE CLASSIFICATION AND STAGING\n\nCML is categorized into three distinct phases:\n\n### 3.1 Chronic Phase (CP)\n- Peripheral blood/bone marrow blasts <10%\n- No features of accelerated or blast phase\n\n### 3.2 Accelerated Phase (AP)\n- Peripheral blood/bone marrow blasts 10-19%\n- Accelerated cytogenetic abnormalities (ACA)\n- Trisomy 8, isochromosome 17, trisomy 19, or complex karyotype\n\n### 3.3 Blast Phase (BP)\n- Peripheral blood/bone marrow blasts \u226520%\n- Extramedullary myeloid sarcoma\n- >5% lymphoblasts in peripheral blood/bone marrow\n\n## 4.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW\n\nChronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, resulting from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, t(9;22)(q34;q11.2), which creates the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. This fusion gene encodes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that drives the pathogenesis of CML.\n\nThis clinical pathway provides evidence-based guidance for the diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and long-term management of patients with CML, with an emphasis on tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, response assessment, and decision points for treatment modifications.\n\n## 2.
