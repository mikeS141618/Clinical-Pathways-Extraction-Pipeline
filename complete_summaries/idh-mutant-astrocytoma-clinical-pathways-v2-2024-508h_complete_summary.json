    "response": "# Comprehensive Clinical Pathway: IDH Mutant Astrocytoma\n\n## I. DIAGNOSIS AND INITIAL ASSESSMENT\n\n### Initial Presentation and Referral\n- Intracranial imaging suspicious for low-grade or high-grade glioma\n- Refer to Neurosurgery and Neuro-oncology\n  - Consider National NeOncology consult if local VA Neuro-oncology unavailable\n- Genetic counseling recommended for patients with personal history of other primary cancers or diagnosis <40 years\n\n### Surgical Management Decision Path\n- **Decision point**: Tumor resectability assessment\n  - **If resectable**: Proceed to maximal safe resection\n  - **If non-resectable**: Perform biopsy\n- Obtain post-resection MRI within 72 hours of procedure\n\n## II. MOLECULAR TESTING AND CLASSIFICATION\n\n### Initial Testing Algorithm\n**Pathway selection based on patient characteristics:**\n\n1. **Standard Testing Pathway** (Age >55, non-midline, non-posterior fossa location, no history of previous low-grade glioma)\n   - Perform IDH and ATRX IHC on tumor tissue\n\n2. **Comprehensive Testing Pathway** (Age <55, midline tumor, circumscribed glioma, posterior fossa location, unusual histology, or IDH-wildtype with atypical features)\n   - Order Somatic NGS (DNA and RNA-based comprehensive genomic profiling)\n   - Recommended vendor: Tempus\n\n### Subsequent Testing Based on Initial Results\n1. **If IDH mutation positive:**\n   - FISH testing for 1p/19q codeletion and CDKN2A/B homozygous loss\n   - TERT promoter mutation testing\n\n2. **If IDH wildtype:**\n   - Either FISH (for EGFR amplification, chromosomes 7 and 10 for gain 7/loss 10) OR\n   - Chromosomal microarray\n   - MGMT promoter methylation testing\n\n### Diagnostic Classification\n- **IDH mutant by IHC and ATRX loss** \u2192 Astrocytoma WHO Grade 2 IDH mutant\n- **IDH mutant by IHC, ATRX retained, 1p/19q intact** \u2192 Astrocytoma WHO Grade 4 IDH mutant\n- **IDH mutant by IHC, ATRX retained, 1p/19q co-deleted**:\n  - With CDKN2A or CDKN2B homozygous deletion \u2192 Oligodendroglioma WHO Grade 3\n  - With CDKN2A and CDKN2B intact or single copy deletion \u2192 Oligodendroglioma WHO Grade 2\n\n## III. TREATMENT PATHWAYS\n\n### IDH Mutant Astrocytoma Grade 2\n\n#### Risk Stratification\n- **High Risk Features** (any of):\n  - Age >40 years with residual tumor\n  - Neurologic symptoms including uncontrolled seizures\n  - Atypical neuroimaging with contrast enhancement\n  - Other high-risk features determined by neuropathology\n\n#### Treatment Algorithm\n1. **For Low-Risk Patients (no high-risk features):**\n   - MRI Surveillance Protocol\n\n2. **For High-Risk Patients:**\n   - Refer to Radiation Oncology for RT\n   - **Post-RT decision point (based on KPS):**\n     - **If KPS >60:** Regulatory followed by adjuvant temozolomide for 6-12 months or PCV\n     - **If KPS <60:** Proceed to multidisciplinary discussion\n\n### IDH Mutant Astrocytoma Grades 3-4\n\n#### Treatment Based on Grade and Performance Status\n1. **For Grade 3 with KPS \u226570:**\n   - Radiation Therapy\n   - Post-RT assessment for pseudoprogression\n   - Consider adjuvant temozolomide if no pseudoprogression\n\n2. **For Grade 4 with KPS \u226570:**\n   - Temozolomide (75 mg/m\u00b2/day) for 42 days with concurrent Radiation Therapy\n   - Post-RT assessment for pseudoprogression\n   - If no pseudoprogression \u2192 Adjuvant temozolomide for 6-12 cycles\n\n3. **For Poor Performance Status (KPS <70):**\n   - Individualized approach based on best supportive care principles\n   - Consider multidisciplinary tumor board discussion\n\n## IV. CHEMOTHERAPY PROTOCOLS\n\n### Temozolomide Regimens\n1. **Concurrent with radiation:**\n   - 75 mg/m\u00b2/day for 42 days\n   - Premedication with ondansetron 8mg and dexamethasone 4mg\n\n2. **Adjuvant temozolomide:**\n   - Starting 4 weeks after radiation\n   - Initial dose: 150 mg/m\u00b2 days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle (1st cycle)\n   - Subsequent cycles: Up to 200 mg/m\u00b2 days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle\n   - Duration: 6-12 months\n   \n3. **Alternative weekly regimen:**\n   - For patients with high-dose dexamethasone use or bone marrow toxicities\n   - Dosing adjusted based on MGMT promoter status\n\n4. **PCV (Procarbazine+CCNU+Vincristine):**\n   - Alternative regimen for eligible patients\n\n## V. SURVEILLANCE AND FOLLOW-UP\n\n### MRI Surveillance Protocol\n- **Post-treatment initial assessment:** MRI 4 weeks following radiation\n- **Regular surveillance schedule:**\n  - Every 3-4 months for first 2 years\n  - Every 6 months for years 3-5\n  - At least annually >5 years (continuing >10 years)\n\n### Response Assessment\n- Evaluate for pseudoprogression up to 12 weeks post radiation\n- Consider treatment changes based on radiographic progression and clinical status\n\n## VI. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\n### Clinical Trial Participation\n- Clinical trials should always be considered throughout the pathway\n\n### Multidisciplinary Consultation\n- All complex cases should be discussed through:\n  - Local tumor board OR\n  - National NeOncology CNS Virtual Tumor Board\n\n### VA Presumptive Service Connection\nAutomatic VA disability benefits eligibility for veterans with IDH Mutant Astrocytoma (brain cancer) applies to:\n\n1. **Atomic Veterans Exposed to Ionizing Radiation**\n\n2. **Gulf War and Post 9/11 Veterans** with qualifying service:\n   - Service on/after September 11, 2001 in: Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Uzbekistan, or Yemen, OR\n   - Service in Southwest Asia theater of operations or Somalia on/after August 2, 1990\n\n### Key Abbreviations\n- IDH: Isocitrate Dehydrogenase\n- ATRX: Alpha Thalassemia/Mental Retardation Syndrome X-Linked\n- KPS: Karnofsky Performance Status\n- MGMT: O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase\n- CDKN2A/B: Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A/B\n- PCV: Procarbazine+CCNU+Vincristine\n- IHC: Immunohistochemistry\n- FISH: Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization\n- RT: Radiation Therapy\n\nThis clinical pathway emphasizes a precision medicine approach with molecular testing driving diagnosis and treatment decisions, while incorporating multidisciplinary management throughout the continuum of care.",
