Introduction and Overview\nGastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors (GI-NETs) represent a diverse group of neoplasms that arise from cells of the diffuse neuroendocrine system. This clinical pathway provides a comprehensive approach to the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of these tumors based on their anatomical location, differentiation, functionality, and stage.\n\n## 2. Classification of Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors\nGI-NETs are classified based on several parameters:\n\n1. **Primary Site**:\n   - Gastric\n   - Pancreatic\n   - Duodenal\n   - Midgut (jejunal, ileal)\n   - Hindgut (colonic, rectal)\n   - Appendiceal\n\n2. **Differentiation**:\n   - Well-differentiated (Grade 1/2)\n   - Poorly differentiated\n\n3. **Functionality**:\n   - Functional (hormone-producing with clinical symptoms)\n   - Non-functional\n\n4. **Disease Stage**:\n   - Localized\n   - Metastatic\n\n## 3. Diagnostic Approach & Staging\n\n### Initial Diagnostic Studies:\n- Multiphasic chest and abdominopelvic CT or MRI\n- Somatostatin Receptor Targeted PET (SSTR-PET using DOTATATE or DOTATOC) for well-differentiated NETs\n- FDG-PET for poorly differentiated NETs\n- Endoscopy as clinically indicated\n- Biochemical testing for functional tumors\n\n### Additional Assessments:\n- Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase (DPYD) testing prior to fluoropyrimidine therapy\n- Ki67 proliferation index (should be performed by counting \u2265500 cells in \"hotspot\" regions)\n- Multidisciplinary discussion is recommended for complex cases\n\n## 4.
