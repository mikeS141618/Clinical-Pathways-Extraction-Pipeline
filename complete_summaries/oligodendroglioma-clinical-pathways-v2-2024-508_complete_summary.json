    "response": "# COMPREHENSIVE CLINICAL PATHWAY FOR OLIGODENDROGLIOMA\n\n## OVERVIEW AND CLASSIFICATION\n\nOligodendrogliomas are distinct CNS tumors defined by their molecular profile, specifically IDH mutation with 1p/19q codeletion. Modern management relies on precise molecular characterization and histopathological grading to optimize treatment decisions.\n\n**WHO Classification:**\n- **Grade 2 Oligodendroglioma:** IDH-mutated, 1p/19q codeleted, CDKN2A and CDKN2B intact\n- **Grade 3 Oligodendroglioma:** IDH-mutated, 1p/19q codeleted, CDKN2A or CDKN2B homozygous deletion\n\n## DIAGNOSTIC PATHWAY\n\n### Initial Assessment\n1. **Clinical Presentation:** Neurological symptoms warranting brain imaging\n2. **Neuroimaging:** MRI with and without contrast (CT with contrast if MRI contraindicated)\n3. **Neurosurgical Evaluation:** Assessment of resectability\n\n### Surgical Management\n- **Resectable Lesion:** Maximal safe resection\n- **Unresectable Lesion:** Stereotactic biopsy\n- **Post-operative Imaging:** MRI within 24-72 hours after surgery\n\n### Molecular Testing Algorithm\n\n**Pathway Selection Based on Patient Characteristics:**\n\n1. **Standard Testing (Age >55, non-midline, non-posterior fossa tumor):**\n   - IHC for IDH1 R132 mutation and ATRX\n   - If IDH-mutated \u2192 1p/19q FISH for codeletion and CDKN2A/B testing\n   - If IDH-wildtype \u2192 TERT promoter mutation, EGFR amplification, chromosome 7/10 status\n\n2. **Comprehensive Testing (For complex cases):**\n   - Age <55, midline tumor, unusual histology, or atypical features\n   - Somatic NGS for DNA and RNA-based comprehensive genomic profiling\n\n**Diagnostic Classification Decision Tree:**\n- IDH-mutated + ATRX retained + 1p/19q codeleted \u2192 Oligodendroglioma\n  - CDKN2A/B intact \u2192 Grade 2\n  - CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion \u2192 Grade 3\n- IDH-mutated + ATRX lost \u2192 Astrocytoma WHO grade 2\n- IDH-wildtype + molecular alterations (EGFR amplification, +7/-10, etc.) \u2192 Glioblastoma\n\n## TREATMENT PATHWAY: GRADE 2 OLIGODENDROGLIOMA\n\n### Initial Management\n- Refer to Radiation Oncology within 12 weeks post-surgery\n\n### Treatment Decision Points\n1. **Performance Status Assessment:**\n   - **KPS \u226570:**\n     - Option 1: Radiation Therapy (RT)\n     - Option 2: Adjuvant temozolomide\n     - Option 3: RT followed by adjuvant therapy\n   - **KPS <70:**\n     - MRI surveillance\n     - Consider best supportive care\n\n2. **Treatment Options Based on Risk Stratification:**\n   - **High-risk features:** Adjuvant PCV with RT\n   - **Standard risk:** RT alone or adjuvant temozolomide with RT\n   - **Favorable molecular features:** Consider MRI surveillance\n\n### Adjuvant Therapy Protocols\n- **PCV Regimen:** Six cycles, repeating every 6 weeks\n  - Procarbazine 60mg/m\u00b2 days 8-21\n  - CCNU (lomustine) 110mg/m\u00b2 day 1\n  - Vincristine 1.4mg/m\u00b2 (max 2mg) days 8 and 29\n- **Temozolomide:** 75mg/m\u00b2 during RT, followed by maintenance regimen\n\n## TREATMENT PATHWAY: GRADE 3 OLIGODENDROGLIOMA\n\n### Initial Management\n- Post-surgical MRI within 24-72 hours\n- Molecular confirmation of IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion\n- Referral to Neuro-oncology and Radiation Oncology\n\n### Treatment Decision Points\n1. **Performance Status Assessment:**\n   - **KPS \u226570:** Proceed to Radiation Therapy\n   - **KPS <70:** Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion\n\n2. **Post-Radiation Assessment (for IDH-mutated + 1p/19q codeleted tumors):**\n   - **Extensive residual enhancement:**\n     - Adjuvant chemotherapy with Temozolomide\n     - MRI surveillance every 2-3 months\n   - **No extensive residual enhancement:**\n     - Adjuvant PCV regimen\n     - MRI surveillance every 2-3 months\n\n### Adjuvant Therapy Protocols\n- **PCV Regimen:** Six cycles every 6 weeks\n  - CCNU (Lomustine) 90mg/m\u00b2 orally on day 1\n  - Vincristine 1.5mg/m\u00b2 IV on day 8 and post-procarbazine thrombocytopenia delay\n  - Procarbazine 60mg/m\u00b2 orally days 8-21\n- **Dose Adjustment:** Based on hematologic toxicity\n  - For neutropenia/severe adverse effects: Reduce temozolomide to 150mg/m\u00b2 for 5 days\n\n## SURVEILLANCE PROTOCOL\n\n### Grade 2 Oligodendroglioma\n- MRI with and without contrast:\n  - Every 3 months for first 2 years\n  - Every 6 months for years 3-5\n  - At least annually thereafter\n\n### Grade 3 Oligodendroglioma\n- MRI surveillance:\n  - At least every 3 months for first 5 years\n  - Every 6 months for years 5-10\n  -
