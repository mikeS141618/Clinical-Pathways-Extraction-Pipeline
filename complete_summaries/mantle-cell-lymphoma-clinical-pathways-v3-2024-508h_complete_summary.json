    "thinking": "I need to create a comprehensive, authoritative summary of the Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) Clinical Pathway based on the information provided. I'll organize this systematically, focusing on the diagnostic approach, staging-based treatment pathways, and management of relapsed/refractory disease.\n\nLet me outline the major sections first:\n\n1. Introduction and Overview of MCL\n2. Diagnostic Evaluation and Molecular Testing\n3. Treatment Pathways by Stage:\n   - Stage I and Contiguous Stage II MCL\n   - Bulky Stage II, Stage III, and Stage IV MCL\n   - Relapsed or Refractory MCL\n4. Special Considerations\n5. VA Presumptive Service Connection (as this is a VA document)\n\nNow I'll create a comprehensive clinical pathway document that serves as a definitive reference for healthcare providers:\n\n## 1. Introduction and Overview\nMantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) is a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by t(11;14) translocation and cyclin D1 overexpression. This clinical pathway provides evidence-based guidance for the diagnosis and management of MCL, emphasizing proper diagnostic evaluation, risk stratification, and stage-appropriate treatment selection.\n\n## 2. Diagnostic Evaluation and Molecular Testing\n\n### Essential Diagnostic Components\n- Comprehensive tissue evaluation including morphology and immunophenotype\n- IHC or flow cytometry must include CD3, CD20, CD5, and cyclin D1 markers\n- SOX11 IHC and/or FISH for t(11;14) IGH::CCND1 (at pathologist discretion)\n- Ki-67 IHC (prognostic cutoff of 30%, >30% indicates more aggressive disease)\n- Molecular testing for TP53 mutations\n- FISH for del 17p (TP53)\n\n### Required Baseline Testing\n- HIV, Hepatitis, LDH, uric acid\n- CBC with differential, CMP\n- PET scan\n- Bone marrow biopsy\n- Consider endoscopy to:\n  * Confirm limited stage disease\n  * Evaluate GI symptoms\n  * Assess iron deficiency anemia\n- Lumbar puncture for patients with CNS symptoms\n- Cardiovascular risk assessment (ECHO or MUGA)\n\n### Disease Classification\nMCL can be classified into two distinct clinical presentations:\n\n1. **Indolent MCL**\n   - Leukemic/non-nodal CLL-like presentation\n   - Low tumor burden (Ki-67 <10%)\n   - CD5 positive, cyclin D1 positive\n   - Often SOX11 negative\n   - Clinical observation shows stability\n\n2. **Classical/Aggressive MCL**\n   - Typical nodal presentation\n   - Blastoid variant has particularly poor prognosis\n   - Often SOX11 positive\n   - Higher Ki-67 (typically >30%)\n\n### Prognostic Factors\n- TP53 mutations or del(17p) confer poor prognosis\n- Ki-67 >30% indicates more aggressive disease\n- Blastoid/pleomorphic variants have inferior outcomes\n\n## 3. Treatment Pathways by Stage\n\n### Stage I and Contiguous Stage II MCL\n\n**Standard Treatment Approach:**\n- Induction chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy (30 Gy)\n- Bendamustine/rituximab is the preferred regimen for younger, fit patients\n\n**Key Components:**\n- Clinical trials should be considered throughout treatment\n- Proper staging confirmation with bone marrow biopsy is essential\n- Rituximab administration requires hepatitis B screening\n  * HBV DNA testing if HBsAg or HBcAb positive\n  * Entecavir prescription required if HBsAg or HBcAb positive\n\n### Bulky Stage II, Stage III, and Stage IV MCL\n\n**Indolent MCL Pathway:**\n- Initially observe patients with indolent presentation without treatment indications\n- Initiate treatment when any of these occur:\n  * Anemia (Hgb <10 g/dL)\n  * Platelets <100,000/mm\u00b3\n  * Thrombocytopenia/anemia (non-immune)\n  * B-symptoms\n  * Symptomatic adenopathy\n- When treatment indicated, follow the Classical/Aggressive MCL pathway\n\n**Classical/Aggressive MCL Pathway:**\n\n1. **For candidates for aggressive induction:**\n   - Option 1: Refer to Cell Therapy Team\n   - Option 2: RDHAP/RCHOP (LYMA regimen)\n     * Addition of cytarabine improves failure-free survival\n     * Watch for cytopenias and infections when combined with BTKi\n\n2. **For non-candidates for aggressive induction:**\n   - Bendamustine and rituximab\n\n3. **Maintenance therapy for responsive disease:**\n   - Rituximab maintenance (maximum duration: 3 years)\n   - Monitor for disease progression\n\n4. **For non-responsive disease:**\n   - Follow Mantle Cell Lymphoma Refractory or Relapsed pathway\n\n### Relapsed or Refractory MCL\n\n**Initial Assessment:**\n- Confirm relapsed/refractory status with excisional biopsy\n- Determine if patient is a candidate for aggressive therapy\n\n**Pathway for Candidates for Aggressive Therapy:**\n1.

Treatment options:\n   - CAR T-cell therapy\n   - Autologous stem cell transplantation\n   - If no cellular therapy and prior chemotherapy response >24 months:\n     * Patient choice between bendamustine/rituximab (if not used before) or acalabrutinib\n   - If no cellular therapy and prior chemotherapy response <24 months:\n     * Acalabrutinib\n\n**Pathway for Non-Candidates for Aggressive Therapy:**\n1. If covalent BTKi refractory (acalabrutinib, ibrutinib, or zanubrutinib):\n   - Patient choice between lenalidomide/rituximab or bortezomib/rituximab\n2. If not BTKi refractory:\n   - Acalabrutinib\n\n**Further Treatment Options:**\n- Consider pirtobrutinib for third-line treatment and for patients with prior covalent BTKi exposure\n\n## 4. Special Considerations\n\n### TP53 Mutations\n- Confers poor prognosis\n- No standard therapy recommendation\n- Autologous transplant might not be beneficial\n- Consider clinical trials or alternate therapies with novel agents\n\n### Rituximab Administration\n- Hepatitis B serology required before starting anti-CD20 therapy\n- HBV DNA testing if HBsAg or HBcAb positive\n- Entecavir prescription required if HBsAg or HBcAb positive\n\n### Regimens\n- **RDHAP:** rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, platinum agent (cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin)\n- **RCHOP:** rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone\n\n### Clinical Trials\n- Clinical trials should always be considered throughout the pathway\n- For assistance finding clinical trials: CancerClinicalTrialsNavigation@va.gov\n\n## 5. VA Presumptive Service Connection\n\nVeterans with Mantle Cell Lymphoma may be eligible for presumptive service connection under specific criteria:\n\n### Atomic Veterans \u2013 Exposure to Ionizing Radiation\n- MCL qualifies as a lymphoma other than Hodgkin's disease\n- Requires documented exposure to ionizing radiation during military service\n\n### Gulf War and Post 9/11 Veterans\n- Service on or after September 11, 2001 in:\n  * Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Uzbekistan, Yemen\n- Service on or after August 2, 1990 in:\n  * Southwest Asia theater of operations (Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, Oman, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, and airspace above these locations)\n  * Somalia\n\nThis comprehensive clinical pathway provides a structured approach to MCL management based on stage, disease characteristics, and patient factors. Treatment decisions should be individualized considering patient preferences, comorbidities, and available resources. Clinical trials should be considered throughout the treatment course."
