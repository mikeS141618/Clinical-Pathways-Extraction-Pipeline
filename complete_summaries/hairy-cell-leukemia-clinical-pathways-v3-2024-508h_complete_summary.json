Disease Overview\n\nHairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) is a rare chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the accumulation of abnormal B-lymphocytes with \"hairy\" cytoplasmic projections. It typically presents with pancytopenia, splenomegaly, and minimal lymphadenopathy. The disease is characterized by the BRAF V600E mutation in approximately 85-90% of classic cases.\n\nBased on WHO 5th edition classification:\n- Classic Hairy Cell Leukemia is BRAF V600E positive\n- Hairy Cell Variant is now classified as Splenic B-cell Lymphoma with prominent nucleoli (BRAF V600E negative)\n\n## 2.

Initial Assessment\n\n### 3.1 Required Baseline Testing\n- CBC with differential\n- Comprehensive metabolic panel\n- Hepatitis B serology\n- HIV testing\n- Hepatitis C testing\n- Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate with flow cytometry\n- BRAF V600E mutation testing (by IHC or molecular testing)\n\n### 3.2 Molecular Testing Pathway\n1. **Initial Diagnostic Testing:**\n   - IHC/Flow Cytometry for expression of CD20, CD22, CD11c, CD200 and co-expression of CD25, CD103, CD123, TRAP, Annexin-A1, cyclin D1, TBX21/T-Bet\n\n2. **BRAF Mutation Testing:**\n   - Option A: BRAF V600E mutation by Immunohistochemistry (IHC)\n   - Option B: BRAF V600E mutation by Molecular Testing (if not tested by IHC)\n\n3. **For BRAF-Negative Cases with Clinical/Pathological Suspicion for HCL:**\n   - Somatic Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) panel focusing on:\n     - MEK-ERK pathway genes (BRAF, MAP2K1)\n     - Other significant genes (CDKN1B, KMT2C, KLF2, TP53, NOTCH2, CCND3, U2AF1, BCOR, IKBKB, TNFAIP3, TRAF3, MAP3K14, TRAF2, BIRC3, MYD88)\n\n## 4. Treatment Decision Algorithm for Newly Diagnosed HCL\n\n### 4.1 Treatment Indication Criteria\nTreatment is indicated if ANY of the following are present:\n- ANC <1000/mm\u00b3\n- Hemoglobin <11 g/dL\n- Platelets <100,000/mm\u00b3\n- Constitutional or B-symptoms (weight loss, fever, fatigue, night sweats)\n- Symptomatic splenomegaly\n\n### 4.2 Management Algorithm\n1. **If treatment is NOT indicated:**\n   - Monitor patient every 3-6 months\n\n2. **If treatment IS indicated:**\n   - Administer Cladribine 0.14 mg/kg IV daily for 5 days (one cycle)\n   - Implement supportive care (see section 4.3)\n\n### 4.3 Supportive Care\n- Frequent monitoring of CBCs for first 6 weeks after initial therapy\n- PJP and varicella prophylaxis for first 12 months after Cladribine\n- Ensure patient's vaccinations are up to date (COVID, influenza, pneumococcus, varicella-zoster)\n- Avoid live attenuated vaccines\n- Screen for secondary malignancies, particularly non-melanoma skin cancers\n\n### 4.4 Response Assessment\n- Delayed response is typical\n- Blood counts may not normalize until at least 6-9 months after treatment\n\n## 5. Management of Relapsed Hairy Cell Leukemia\n\n### 5.1 Treatment Indication Criteria\nSame as for newly diagnosed disease:\n- ANC <1000/mm\u00b3\n- Hemoglobin <11 g/dL\n- Platelets <100,000/mm\u00b3\n- Constitutional or B-symptoms\n- Symptomatic splenomegaly\n\n### 5.2 Management Algorithm for Relapsed Disease\n1. **If treatment is NOT indicated:**\n   - Monitor every 3-6 months\n\n2. **If treatment IS indicated:**\n   - **If duration of initial response >24 months:**\n     * Administer Cladribine (single cycle)\n     * Apply same supportive care as in section 4.3\n\n   - **If duration of initial response <24 months:**\n     * Administer Vemurafenib and Rituximab\n     * Baseline labs: CBC, metabolic panel, Hepatitis B serology, HIV testing, Hepatitis C\n     * Note: Limited therapy duration; maintenance rituximab increases infectious risk\n\n### 5.3 Special Considerations for Relapsed Cases\n- **Poor Responders/Early Relapses:** Consider referral to cell therapy\n- **For Rituximab (when added to Cladribine):**\n  * Increases risk of infection, including COVID\n  * Obtain Hepatitis B serologies prior to starting anti-CD20 antibody therapy\n  * Consider HBV DNA testing if HBsAg or HBcAb positive\n  * Prescribe entecavir if HBsAg or HBcAb positive\n\n## 6. VA Presumptive Conditions for Hairy Cell Leukemia\n\n- Atomic Veterans with exposure to ionizing radiation may be eligible for presumptive disability benefits\n- All forms of leukemia, including Hairy Cell Leukemia, are covered (with the exception of chronic lymphocytic leukemia)\n- This allows veterans to be awarded disability compensation without having to prove service connection\n- For more comprehensive information about Presumptive Disability Benefits, refer to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs website (va.gov)\n\n## 7. Additional Notes and Considerations\n\n- Clinical trials should always be considered as part of the treatment pathway\n- This pathway applies specifically to classic HCL (BRAF V600E positive)\n- Splenic B-cell Lymphoma with prominent nucleoli (formerly Hairy Cell Variant) is BRAF V600E negative and requires a different management approach\n- Secondary malignancies, particularly non-melanoma skin cancers, are a concern and require regular screening\n- The presence of the BRAF V600E mutation is a distinguishing molecular marker for classic HCL and has therapeutic implications, particularly for relapsed/refractory disease\n\nThat looks comprehensive and covers all the key components of the clinical pathway for Hairy Cell Leukemia as presented in the document. I've organized it in a logical flow from diagnosis through initial treatment to management of relapsed disease, with appropriate attention to special considerations and VA-specific information. This should serve as a useful reference for clinicians managing patients with HCL."
