Surveillance Protocols\n\n### Surgically Treated NSCLC\n1. **Years 1-2**:\n   - H&P: Every 6 months (including smoking cessation counseling)\n   - CT Chest: Every 6 months\n   - Initial baseline scan within 3 months of definitive treatment\n\n2. **Years 3-5**:\n   - H&P: Annually\n   - CT Chest: Annually\n\n3. **Year 5+**:\n   - H&P: Annually\n   - CT Chest: Annual low-dose CT (for second primary malignancy screening)\n\n### NSCLC Stage III After Chemoradiation\n1. **Baseline**: CT of Chest within 3 months of completing definitive treatment\n\n2. **H&P Examinations**:\n   - Year 1: Every 3 months\n   - Year 2: Every 4 months\n   - Years 3-5+: Every 6 months\n   - Include smoking cessation counseling at each visit\n\n3. **Chest CT Scans**:\n   - Year 1: Every 3 months\n   - Year 2: Every 4 months\n   - Years 3-5: Every 6 months\n   - Year 5+: Annual low-dose CT\n\n### Important Surveillance Notes\n- Routine brain imaging is not recommended unless clinically indicated\n- Year 1 scheduling for post-chemoradiation is not intended for immunotherapy consolidation guidance\n- Low-dose CT scans in later years serve for both surveillance and screening for second primaries\n- Patients treated with SBRT may require more frequent scanning intervals\n- Surveillance begins after completion of all definitive treatment\n\nThis is a comprehensive summary of the lung cancer clinical pathway as presented in the provided documents. The pathway emphasizes multidisciplinary care, molecular testing for treatment selection, and appropriate surveillance based on disease stage and treatment modality."
