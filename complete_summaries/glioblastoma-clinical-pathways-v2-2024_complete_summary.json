    "thinking": "I will create a comprehensive summary of the clinical pathway for glioblastoma based on the information provided across all pages. I'll organize it in a structured, logical format that follows the typical sequence of patient care, from initial presentation through diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up monitoring.\n\nFrom the information provided, I can see this is a VA clinical pathway document for glioblastoma management that includes:\n1. Information about VA presumptive conditions related to glioblastoma (for veterans' benefits)\n2. Initial evaluation and management approach\n3. Molecular testing pathways\n4. Detailed molecular testing algorithms\n\nLet me synthesize this into a comprehensive clinical pathway:\n\n# COMPREHENSIVE GLIOBLASTOMA CLINICAL PATHWAY\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nGlioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults. This clinical pathway provides a standardized approach to the diagnosis, molecular characterization, treatment, and follow-up care for patients with suspected or confirmed glioblastoma.\n\n## II. VA PRESUMPTIVE CONDITIONS (VETERANS' BENEFITS INFORMATION)\nCertain veterans may qualify for VA disability benefits as glioblastoma may be considered a presumptive condition (automatically presumed connected to military service) for:\n\n### A. Veterans Exposed to Ionizing Radiation (\"Atomic Veterans\")\n- Brain cancer, including glioblastoma, is a presumptive condition\n\n### B. Gulf War and Post 9/11 Veterans who served:\n- On or after September 11, 2001 in:\n  * Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Uzbekistan, Yemen\n- OR in the Southwest Asia theater of operations or Somalia on or after August 2, 1990\n  * Southwest Asia Theater includes: Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, and airspace above these locations\n\n## III. INITIAL EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH\n\n### A. Initial Presentation and Imaging\n1. Initial structural imaging (MRI preferred) suspicious for high-grade glioma\n2. If MRI is contraindicated, CT with contrast should be considered as an alternative\n3. Referral to Neurosurgery for evaluation\n\n### B. Surgical Management Decision Point\n1. Assessment of resectability\n   - **If resectable**: Proceed to maximal safe resection\n   - **If not resectable**: Proceed to stereotactic biopsy\n2. Post-operative MRI within 72 hours of surgery to assess extent of resection\n\n### C. Histopathological Assessment\n1. Pathological confirmation of high-grade glioma\n2. Referral for molecular testing (per Molecular Testing pathway)\n3. Confirmation of glioblastoma diagnosis based on histology and molecular features\n\n### D. Post-Surgical Referrals\n1. Refer to Neuro-oncology\n   - National TeleOncology available if local VA Neuro-oncology is unavailable\n2. Refer to Radiation Oncology\n3.
