General Recommendations\n\n1. **Clinical Trial Consideration**\n   - Clinical trials should always be considered at all stages of treatment\n   - For assistance: CancerClinicalTrialsNavigation@va.gov\n\n2. **Multidisciplinary Approach**\n   - Integrated care involving surgical oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology\n   - Early palliative care involvement for advanced disease\n\n3. **Supportive Care**\n   - Nutritional assessment and support\n   - Palliative interventions (stenting, radiation) as needed\n   - Hospice referral when appropriate\n\nThis clinical pathway provides a comprehensive, evidence-based approach to gastric cancer management, with specific guidance based on disease stage, molecular profile, and patient factors to optimize clinical outcomes.",
    "thinking": "To create a comprehensive summary of the gastric cancer clinical pathway, I'll organize the information from all the analyzed pages into a cohesive and structured format that presents the entire care continuum for gastric cancer patients. I'll focus on key decision points, diagnostic processes, treatment options by disease stage, and specialized considerations.\n\nLet me organize the main components of the pathway:\n\n1. Initial Assessment and Diagnosis\n2. Molecular Testing and Biomarker Assessment\n3. Clinical Pathways by Disease Stage:\n   - Suspected T1 N0 (Early Stage)\n   - Locally Advanced Resectable (T2 or higher or N+ and M0)\n   - Completely Resected T2 or Higher (Any N, M0)\n   - Unresectable or Stage IV (Metastatic)\n     - MSS HER2 Positive (First Line)\n     - MSS HER2 Positive (Second Line)\n     - MSS HER2 Negative (First Line)\n     - MSS HER2 Negative (Second Line)\n     - MSI High\n\n4. Special Considerations (including VA presumptive conditions for veterans)\n\nNow I'll create a comprehensive clinical pathway summary that integrates all this information:"
