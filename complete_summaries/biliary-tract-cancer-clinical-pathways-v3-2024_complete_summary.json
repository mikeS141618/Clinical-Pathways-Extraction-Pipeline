Special Considerations and Transplantation\n7. Clinical Trial Considerations\n\nNow, I'll develop each section based on the analyzed information:\n\n## 1. Introduction and Overview\n\nBiliary tract cancers include cholangiocarcinoma (intrahepatic and extrahepatic) and gallbladder cancer. The clinical pathways presented provide evidence-based approaches to diagnosing and treating these cancers, with emphasis on appropriate staging, multidisciplinary decision-making, and molecular testing to guide personalized treatment.\n\n## 2. Diagnosis and Initial Assessment\n\n### a. Diagnostic Workup\nFor all suspected biliary tract cancers, the following diagnostic procedures should be considered:\n- Multiphase CT or MRI with contrast\n- CT chest\n- Laboratory tests: CEA, CA 19-9, AFP, LFTs, viral hepatitis serologies\n- Contrast MRI with MRCP (preferred for gallbladder masses and tumors with bile duct involvement)\n- Delayed phase imaging (preferred for intrahepatic bile duct cancer)\n\n### b. Staging Requirements\nAccurate staging is essential for determining the appropriate treatment pathway. Key elements include:\n- Assessment of primary tumor extent\n- Lymph node involvement\n- Presence or absence of distant metastases\n- Resectability assessment\n\n## 3. Disease-Specific Pathways\n\n### a. Extrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma\nFor patients with suspected extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (including perihilar):\n1. Determine whether disease is Stage IV using comprehensive staging workup\n2. If Stage IV: Proceed to tissue biopsy and follow Unresectable/Metastatic pathway\n3. If not Stage IV: Assess resectability\n   - If resectable: Complete resection with regional lymph node dissection\n     - Distal bile duct tumors: Pancreaticoduodenectomy\n     - Proximal perihilar tumors: Major hepatic resection\n     - Proceed to Completely Resected pathway\n   - If unresectable: Follow Unresectable/Metastatic pathway\n     - Consider transplant evaluation for unresectable perihilar/hilar cholangiocarcinomas \u22643 cm without metastases and nodal disease\n\n### b.

Gallbladder Cancer\nFor patients with suspected or incidental gallbladder cancer, the pathway depends on the diagnosis mode:\n\n1. Diagnosis via Imaging:\n   - Complete clinical staging\n   - If Stage IV (unresectable): Follow Unresectable/Metastatic pathway\n   - If resectable: Resection of liver segments IVB/V with en bloc gallbladder (if present) and portal lymphadenectomy, then follow Completely Resected pathway\n\n2. Diagnosis via Pathology after cholecystectomy:\n   - If T1a with negative margins: No further treatment required\n   - If T1a with positive margins or \u2265T1b: Continue to staging and treatment planning\n   - If cystic duct node positive: Conduct post-operative staging and multidisciplinary discussion to determine:\n     - Either neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by resection of liver segments IVB/V with en bloc gallbladder (if present) and portal lymphadenectomy, then follow Resected pathway\n     - Or follow Unresectable/Metastatic pathway\n\n## 4.

Unresectable/Metastatic Disease - First Line\nFor patients with unresectable and/or metastatic biliary tract cancer who are fit for combination chemotherapy:\n1. Determine if patient is a candidate for immunotherapy\n   - Exclude patients with prior solid organ transplant or uncontrolled autoimmune/inflammatory conditions\n   - If yes: Administer durvalumab, gemcitabine, and cisplatin\n     - Continue chemotherapy for up to 8 cycles (if tolerated)\n     - Follow with durvalumab maintenance for up to 2 years\n   - If no: Administer gemcitabine and cisplatin\n     - Continue chemotherapy for up to 8 cycles (if tolerated)\n2. Conduct restaging per institutional standards\n3.
