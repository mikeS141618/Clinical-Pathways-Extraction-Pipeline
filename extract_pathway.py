1. Identify the key decision points in the clinical pathway:
   - Initial assessment criteria
   - Risk stratification methods
   - First-line treatment options
   - Second-line and subsequent treatments
   - Monitoring and follow-up protocols

2. Map the logical flow between decision points, including:
   - Conditional branches (if/then scenarios)
   - Treatment sequences
   - Assessment checkpoints
   - Progression pathways

3. Include critical clinical parameters:
   - Required testing (genetic, imaging, lab values)
   - Medication specifics and timing
   - Response evaluation criteria
   - Indications for alternative pathways

4. Preserve any special considerations:
   - Patient eligibility criteria
   - Symptom-based decision making
   - Multidisciplinary consultation requirements
   - Clinical trial options

5. For complex pathways, consider dividing the flowchart into logical sections (e.g., "Initial Assessment," "First-line Treatment," "Treatment for Progression") to maintain readability.

Produce the flowchart and include a brief legend explaining any specialized notation used. If you cannot create a sufficiently detailed visual representation, provide a text-based flowchart using indentation, bullets, and directional markers (â†’, â†“) to show the clinical pathway flow.

When critical details must be condensed, provide a "Clinical Notes" section following the flowchart that explains important nuances that couldn't be fully captured in the visual representation. Mark this section with [SUPPLEMENTAL DETAILS] to indicate these are elements that enhance the main flowchart.

If you believe any important clinical information might be lost or unclear in your representation, flag the specific sections with [DETAIL ALERT] and provide additional clarification."""
