If treatment is not required, the patient should be monitored every 3-6 months\n5. If treatment is required, Cladribine is the recommended therapy (0.14 mg/kg IV daily for 5 days for one cycle)\n6. After Cladribine therapy, response should be assessed, noting that delayed response is typical and blood counts may not normalize until at least 6-9 months\n7. Supportive care includes frequent CBC monitoring for the first 6 weeks, PJP and varicella prophylaxis for 12 months, and avoiding live vaccines\n\nI'll also note the important details about diagnosis and other special considerations:\n\n- Diagnosis requires bone marrow biopsy or peripheral blood showing characteristic cytology and/or bone marrow morphology, characteristic immunophenotype by flow cytometry, and molecular testing for BRAF V600E mutation\n- Baseline labs should include CBC, metabolic panel, Hepatitis B and C serology, and HIV testing\n- The pathway distinguishes Hairy Cell Leukemia from Splenic B-cell Lymphoma with prominent nucleoli, noting the latter is BRAF V600E negative and considered a heterogeneous group not covered by this pathway\n\nI'll structure all this information in a clear, comprehensive text description of the clinical pathway."

      "response": "# Comprehensive Clinical Pathway for Hairy Cell Leukemia Management\n\nHairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) diagnosis is established through bone marrow biopsy or peripheral blood evaluation, characterized by cells with ground-glass chromatin, cytoplasmic projections, and a specific immunophenotype (CD20+, CD22+, CD11c+, CD103+, CD25+, CD123+, annexin-1+). Diagnosis is confirmed via BRAF V600E mutation testing using either immunohistochemistry or molecular methods. Initial assessment requires CBC, metabolic panel, and hepatitis B/C and HIV testing. Treatment initiation is guided by specific criteria: ANC <1000/mm\u00b3, hemoglobin <11 g/dL, platelets <100,000/mm\u00b3, constitutional symptoms, or symptomatic splenomegaly. If these thresholds aren't met, monitoring every 3-6 months is recommended.\n\nFirst-line treatment consists of single-cycle cladribine, with rituximab addition considered for certain patients. For relapsed disease, management follows a response duration-based approach: if initial response exceeded 24 months, single-cycle cladribine is repeated; if less than 24 months, vemurafenib plus rituximab is recommended. Special considerations exist for variant HCL (IGHV4-34 testing) and BRAF-negative cases (MAP2K1 testing), which may influence treatment decisions. Poor responders or early relapses should be considered for cell therapy referral.\n\nClinical trials should be considered at all decision points when available. The pathway acknowledges HCL as a VA presumptive condition for Atomic Veterans exposed to ionizing radiation, facilitating disability compensation without requiring service connection proof.",
