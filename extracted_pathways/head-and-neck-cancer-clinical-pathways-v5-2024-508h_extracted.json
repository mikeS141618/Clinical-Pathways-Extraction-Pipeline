The first critical decision point is whether the patient is a candidate for functional organ preservation.\n\n### If NOT a candidate for functional organ preservation:\n- Proceed directly to total laryngectomy with nodal basin dissection\n  - Note: For patients with T4 disease with obvious cartilage invasion, laryngectomy with nodal basis dissection is preferred\n\n### If candidate for functional organ preservation:\n- Assess if patient is a candidate for partial laryngectomy with nodal basin dissection\n  - If YES: Proceed to partial laryngectomy with nodal basin dissection\n  - If NO: Administer radiation to primary site and nodal basin with cisplatin\n\n## Post-Surgical Assessment\n\nFollowing partial laryngectomy, patients are evaluated for adverse features:\n\n### If adverse features present:\n- Features include: extranodal extension, positive margins, close margins, pT3 or pT4 primary, pN2 or pN3 nodal disease, nodal disease in levels IV or V, perineural invasion, perivascular/vascular invasion, or lymphatic invasion\n- Assess for extranodal extension or positive margins specifically\n  - If present: Determine if patient is a candidate for cisplatin\n    - If YES: Administer cisplatin with radiation\n    - If NO: Administer radiation alone\n  - If not present: Determine if patient is a candidate for systemic therapy\n    - If YES: Administer cetuximab and docetaxel with radiation\n    - If NO: Administer radiation alone\n\n### If no adverse features present:\n- Proceed to surveillance\n\n## Special Considerations\n\n1. **Cisplatin Eligibility:** Candidates for cisplatin should have ECOG Performance Status 0-1 with minimal comorbidities, as toxicities may be anticipated (nephrotoxicity, neutropenia, nausea/vomiting, etc.)\n\n2. **Supportive Care:** All patients should be evaluated for support regarding:\n   - Tobacco use/smoking cessation\n   - Dental health\n   - Nutrition\n   - Audiology\n   - Speech/swallowing function\n\n3. **Clinical Trials:** Clinical trials should always be considered throughout the pathway.

The decision between radiation-based and surgical approaches is likely based on multiple factors including:\n- Primary tumor characteristics\n- Location and extent of recurrence\n- Prior treatments received\n- Patient performance status\n- Patient preferences\n\nThe pathway appears to be part of a larger treatment algorithm that contains more detailed radiation and surgical protocols that would be followed once the treatment modality is selected.",

Based on this discussion, the patient is directed to either follow a radiation-based pathway or a surgery-based pathway, depending on the primary tumor site.\n\nThe note emphasizes that clinical trials should always be considered as an option throughout the treatment pathway, providing contact information for assistance in finding appropriate trials.\n\nNow I'll structure this information into a clear, comprehensive text description:"

The pathways consistently begin with risk stratification based on tumor characteristics, with initial decision points typically assessing surgical candidacy or organ preservation potential. For early-stage disease (T1-2, N0), treatment options generally include either primary surgical resection or definitive radiation therapy, with selection informed by shared decision-making. More advanced disease (T3-4 or N+) typically requires multimodal approaches combining surgery with adjuvant therapy or chemoradiation. Post-surgical pathways incorporate assessment for adverse features (extranodal extension, positive margins, perineural/lymphovascular invasion), which trigger recommendations for adjuvant radiation or chemoradiation. Special biomarkers guide therapy selection, particularly HPV status for oropharyngeal cancers and EBV for nasopharyngeal cancers. For recurrent or metastatic disease, options include salvage surgery, reirradiation, systemic therapy (platinum-based chemotherapy), and immunotherapy based on PD-L1 status. Treatment decisions consistently consider patient-specific factors such as performance status, comorbidities, and organ function, with cisplatin candidacy representing a key decision point for concurrent or adjuvant chemoradiation. The pathways emphasize multidisciplinary discussion, supportive care considerations, clinical trial opportunities, and appropriate molecular testing to optimize outcomes.",
