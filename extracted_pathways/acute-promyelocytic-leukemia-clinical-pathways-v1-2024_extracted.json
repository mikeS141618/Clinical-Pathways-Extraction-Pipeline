      "response": "# Comprehensive Summary of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Clinical Pathway\n\nThe clinical pathway for Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) begins with prompt recognition of suspected cases based on coagulopathy, hypergranular morphology, and cytoplasmic inclusions. ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid) should be initiated immediately upon clinical suspicion while awaiting confirmatory molecular testing. Initial evaluation includes coagulation studies, CBC with differential, bone marrow examination, flow cytometry, and critical molecular studies including FISH and PCR for PML-RARA fusion and FLT3 mutation testing. Patients are stratified into high-risk (WBC \u226510,000/mm\u00b3) or low-risk (WBC <10,000/mm\u00b3) categories, determining treatment intensity. Treatment protocols differ based on risk: high-risk patients receive ATRA plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy, while monitoring ANC and platelet recovery guides progression through therapy. Consolidation follows successful induction, with maintenance therapy typically continuing for 1-2 years. For relapsed disease, treatment selection depends on the time elapsed since previous therapy: patients relapsing within 6 months of anthracycline regimens receive ATRA with arsenic trioxide; those relapsing within 6 months of ATRA plus arsenic trioxide receive ATRA with anthracycline; and those relapsing \u22656 months after any therapy receive triple therapy with ATRA, arsenic trioxide, and gemtuzumab. Response assessment utilizes bone marrow biopsy at count recovery (ANC \u22651000/mm\u00b3, platelets \u2265100,000/mm\u00b3), with molecular monitoring for minimal residual disease. This comprehensive approach integrates timely diagnosis, risk-adapted therapy, and tailored relapse management to optimize outcomes in this highly curable form of acute leukemia.",
