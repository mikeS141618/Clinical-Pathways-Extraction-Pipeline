Following diagnosis, patients are evaluated for transplant eligibility, with eligible candidates referred directly to transplant services. For non-transplant candidates, management follows a symptom-based approach. Asymptomatic patients are observed, while symptomatic patients receive targeted therapy based on their specific presentation. Anemia without splenomegaly is initially treated with danazol, with momelotinib as second-line. Patients with anemia plus splenomegaly receive first-line momelotinib. Thrombocytopenia management depends on severity, with pacritinib for severe cases (platelets <50K) and ruxolitinib or fedratinib for moderate cases. For progressive/refractory disease, the pathway first assesses for transformation to AML, directing patients to transplant or AML protocols if positive. For non-AML progression, treatment selection considers previous therapy and current symptoms: patients with progressive anemia receive momelotinib (if not previously used) or pacritinib; those with progressive splenomegaly and low platelets receive pacritinib or momelotinib based on prior exposure; and patients with normal platelets receive ruxolitinib/fedratinib or clinical trial enrollment.
