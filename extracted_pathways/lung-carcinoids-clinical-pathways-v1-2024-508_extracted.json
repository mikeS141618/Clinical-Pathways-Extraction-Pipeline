      "response": "# Comprehensive Lung Carcinoid Clinical Pathway Summary\n\nThe lung carcinoid clinical pathway begins with diagnosis and staging via chest CT with contrast, with DOTA-TATE PET/CT preferred over FBS/FDG imaging. Following multidisciplinary assessment, treatment decisions are guided primarily by resectability status. For resectable stage I-III disease in surgical candidates, the preferred approach is surgical resection with lymph node sampling. Post-surgical management depends on margin status, with positive margins triggering multidisciplinary discussion. Patients with stage II disease and negative margins may be considered for adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy (2.5 cycles). Non-surgical candidates are managed according to their specific contraindications to surgery.\n\nFor metastatic stage III/IV or unresectable typical carcinoid, management stratifies by disease burden and symptom status. Asymptomatic patients with low-burden disease may opt for active surveillance with octreotide long-acting release or lanreotide, progressing to everolimus if disease advances. Symptomatic or higher-burden disease patients undergo dotatate-directed imaging followed by appropriate therapy selection. Treatment options include somatostatin analogs, everolimus, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, and chemotherapy, with monitoring for progression determining subsequent treatment lines.\n\nNotably, current clinical guidance indicates no molecular testing is required for standard prognostication or therapy selection in lung carcinoids. For qualifying veterans, lung carcinoids (typical or atypical) may be considered presumptive service-connected conditions if they served in specified regions during qualifying periods, facilitating access to VA disability benefits.",
