      "response": "# Comprehensive Merkel Cell Carcinoma Clinical Pathway Summary\n\nThe Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) clinical pathway begins with initial evaluation of biopsy-proven disease, proceeding through clinical staging and comprehensive imaging studies. Primary tumor management typically involves wide local excision with appropriate margins. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is recommended for eligible patients, with subsequent management determined by SLN status\u2014observation for SLN-negative cases, while SLN-positive disease may warrant radiation therapy or completion lymphadenectomy. For metastatic disease, systemic imaging (preferably whole-body PET/CT) is performed with specific consideration for CNS involvement. Immunotherapy eligibility is then assessed, with pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or avelumab recommended as first-line therapy for eligible patients without contraindications like active autoimmune disease or immunosuppression. For patients progressing on immunotherapy or ineligible for PD1/PDL1 inhibitors, a multidisciplinary discussion determines candidacy for locoregional treatments. If locoregional treatment is not feasible, options include ipilimumab/nivolumab combination therapy, chemotherapy, or palliative care based on shared decision-making. Follow-up includes regular skin and lymph node examinations, with evidence of recurrence prompting systemic imaging and classification as local, nodal, or distant metastatic recurrence, each with distinct management approaches. Notably, molecular testing is not currently required for standard prognostication or therapy selection in MCC. This pathway is not related to VA presumptive condition benefits, as MCC is not recognized as a presumptive condition.",
