Veteran diagnosed with Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma\n2. Assessment of veteran's service history:\n   - Was the veteran exposed to ionizing radiation during service? \u2192 If yes, presumptive connection applies\n   - Did the veteran serve in Vietnam with Agent Orange exposure? \u2192 If yes, presumptive connection applies (for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma)\n   - Did the veteran serve in specified post-9/11 locations or Southwest Asia theater after August 2, 1990? \u2192 If yes, presumptive connection applies\n3. If any criteria met \u2192 VA presumes the condition was caused by military service\n4. Result: Veteran can be awarded disability compensation\n\nFor additional information, veterans should visit the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Presumptive Disability Benefits website.",

Document Title: \"Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma \u2013 Presumptive Conditions\"\n\n2. Introduction: Explains that the VA automatically presumes certain disabilities were caused by military service for specific veterans based on their service circumstances, allowing them to be awarded disability compensation.\n\n3. Categories of veterans and their presumptive conditions:\n\n   a. Atomic Veterans (Exposure to Ionizing Radiation):\n      - Lymphomas, other than Hodgkin's disease\n\n   b. Vietnam Veterans (Agent Orange Exposure or Specified Locations):\n      - Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma\n\n   c. Gulf War and Post 9/11 Veterans:\n      - If served on/after Sept. 11, 2001 in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Uzbekistan, Yemen\n      - If served in Southwest Asia theater of operations or Somalia on/after Aug. 2, 1990\n      - Presumptive condition: Lymphoma of any type\n\n4. Additional Information:\n   - Definition of the Southwest Asia theater of operations (Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, Oman, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, and airspace above)\n   - Reference to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for more information on Presumptive Disability Benefits\n\nThis is not a typical clinical pathway document with treatment algorithms or decision trees. Instead, it's a document outlining which veterans qualify for presumptive service connection for Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma based on their service circumstances.\n\nGiven that this is not a treatment algorithm but rather eligibility criteria for VA benefits, I'll need to adapt the requested flowchart to represent this information appropriately. I'll create a flowchart that shows the decision pathway for determining if a veteran with this condition qualifies for presumptive service connection."

      "response": "# Comprehensive Summary: Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma Clinical Pathway\n\nThe clinical pathway for Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma (WM/LPL) begins with diagnosis based on IgM monoclonal gammopathy and lymphoplasmacytic infiltration on bone marrow/lymph node biopsy, with MYD88 mutations supporting but not confirming diagnosis. Initial workup includes CBC differential, HIV/hepatitis testing, LDH/uric acid, CT scans, immunoglobulins, and serum protein studies. Molecular testing specifically targets MYD88 and CXCR4 mutations, with CXCR4 mutations conferring negative prognosis. The first treatment decision point assesses if intervention is indicated, based on presence of anemia, bleeding, hyperviscosity, symptomatic adenopathy/organomegaly, or WM-related peripheral neuropathy. Without these indicators, observation is recommended. For first-line treatment, options include rituximab, chemoimmunotherapy, BTK inhibitors, or bortezomib-containing regimens. For relapsed disease, treatment selection follows a structured algorithm based on prior therapy: rituximab-exposed patients may receive zanubrutinib or bendamustine-rituximab; post-chemoimmunotherapy patients receive zanubrutinib; post-BTK inhibitor patients receive bendamustine-rituximab. For multiply-relapsed disease, assessment focuses on refractoriness to BTK inhibitors, bendamustine, and bortezomib, with parallel consideration for cell therapy referral when appropriate. Treatment options at this stage include ibrutinib, everolimus/bortezomib, or clinical trials. For veterans, presumptive service connection is available based on specific exposures (ionizing radiation, Agent Orange) and service history, with lymphomas classified as presumptive conditions for eligible veterans.",
