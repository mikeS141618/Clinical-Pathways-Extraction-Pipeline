Management then diverges based on pathology and staging. For squamous cell carcinoma, three distinct treatment pathways emerge: (1) Localized disease amenable to local excision (well/moderately differentiated T1N0 and select T2N0 tumors), treated initially with surgical excision followed by margin status assessment to determine surveillance versus re-resection or chemoradiation; (2) Locoregional disease not amenable to complete local excision (any T, any N, M0), managed with concurrent chemoradiation (mitomycin plus fluorouracil/capecitabine) after mandatory DPYD testing and multidisciplinary discussion; and (3) Metastatic disease (any T, any N, M1) in patients fit for combination chemotherapy, treated with carboplatin-paclitaxel followed by nivolumab upon progression. Adenocarcinoma follows rectal cancer pathways. Response assessment occurs 8-12 weeks post-chemoradiation, with biopsy for any concerning findings. Long-term surveillance continues for 5 years. Clinical trials should be considered throughout treatment. For veterans, VA presumptive service connection may apply for those who served in qualifying regions (post-9/11 or Gulf War), making gastrointestinal cancers, including anal cancer, potentially eligible for disability compensation without proving service causation.",
