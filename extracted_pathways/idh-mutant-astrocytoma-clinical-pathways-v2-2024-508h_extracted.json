The VA presumptive conditions concept - where certain disabilities are automatically presumed to be service-connected for veterans in specific groups\n2. Two specific veteran groups who may qualify for presumptive service connection for brain cancer:\n   - Atomic Veterans exposed to ionizing radiation\n   - Gulf War and Post 9/11 Veterans who served in specific locations\n\nRather than a clinical pathway for treating IDH Mutant Astrocytoma, this is information about disability benefits eligibility for veterans with this condition based on their service history.\n\nI should explain that the document doesn't contain a clinical pathway for medical treatment, but instead provides information about VA disability presumptions for this specific condition.

Initial management begins with imaging suspicious for glioma, followed by neurosurgical evaluation to determine resectability. Patients undergo either maximal safe resection or biopsy, with post-procedure MRI within 72 hours. Molecular testing confirms IDH mutation status through a tailored algorithm based on patient age, tumor location, and histology. For grade 2 tumors, risk stratification determines subsequent management\u2014low-risk patients proceed to MRI surveillance, while high-risk patients receive radiation therapy. For grades 3-4 tumors, Karnofsky Performance Status guides treatment intensity: patients with KPS \u226570 receive radiation with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide, while those with KPS <70 receive palliative approaches. The molecular testing pathway employs IDH/ATRX immunohistochemistry as first-line testing for older patients with non-midline tumors, while younger patients or those with midline tumors undergo comprehensive FISH testing. Positive IDH mutation prompts further testing for 1p/19q codeletion and CDKN2A/B loss, while IDH-wildtype tumors require EGFR amplification and chromosome 7/10 status assessment. This pathway integrates precise molecular classification with clinical parameters to optimize personalized treatment selection and monitoring strategies.",
