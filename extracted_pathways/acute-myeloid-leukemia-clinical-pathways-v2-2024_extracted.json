I can see you've provided a table of contents from what appears to be a clinical pathway document, but not the actual clinical pathway content itself. The table of contents shows:\n\n1. **Presumptive Conditions** (page 3)\n2. **First Line** (page 4)\n3. **Relapsed** (page 5)\n4. **Molecular Testing Table** (page 6)\n\nFrom this structure, I can infer this is likely a clinical pathway for a condition that requires:\n- Initial diagnosis/presumptive assessment\n- First-line treatment protocols\n- Management of relapsed cases\n- Molecular/genetic testing to guide treatment decisions\n\nHowever, to create a detailed clinical pathway flowchart as requested, I would need to see the actual content on pages 3-6. This would allow me to identify the specific decision points, treatment options, assessment criteria, and logical flows between different clinical scenarios.\n\nWould you be able to share the actual content pages of this clinical pathway document so I can develop a comprehensive flowchart based on the specific protocols outlined in the document?",

Initial workup includes flow cytometry, FISH for key translocations (t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17)), karyotyping, and comprehensive NGS myeloid panel testing for mutations in critical genes including FLT3, IDH1/2, and NPM1. The pathway first stratifies patients based on eligibility for intensive therapy. For intensive therapy candidates, treatment is guided by molecular risk factors: FLT3-mutated patients receive cytarabine, daunorubicin/idarubicin plus midostaurin, while FLT3 wild-type patients are further stratified by cytogenetic risk (favorable, intermediate, unfavorable). Non-intensive therapy candidates receive either venetoclax combinations or supportive care based on performance status. Post-induction, response is assessed by bone marrow biopsy to guide consolidation decisions, which may include additional chemotherapy cycles or allogeneic transplant. For relapsed disease, the pathway recommends confirmation testing including flow cytometry and myeloid NGS, then branches based on prior transplant history and HMA/venetoclax exposure. Relapse management includes decitabine/venetoclax combinations with referral to allogeneic transplant when appropriate. The pathway also notes the presumptive service connection for veterans with AML and radiation exposure, potentially qualifying them for disability benefits.",
