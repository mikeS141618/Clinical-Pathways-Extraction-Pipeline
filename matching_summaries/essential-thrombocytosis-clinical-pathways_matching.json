  "matching_summary": "Essential Thrombocytosis (ET) diagnosis requires bone marrow biopsy with reticulin stain to distinguish from prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis and document baseline fibrosis. Sequential molecular testing includes JAK2 V617F mutation, followed by CALR and MPL mutation testing if JAK2 negative. Cytogenetic testing and FISH analysis for BCR-ABL1 fusion are needed to exclude CML. Risk stratification categorizes patients as high risk (history of thrombosis at any age or age >60 with JAK2 V617F mutation), intermediate risk (age >60, no JAK2 mutation, no thrombosis history, with cardiovascular risk factors), or low risk (age <60, no thrombosis history, with JAK2 V617F mutation). Treatment includes aspirin 81mg daily for all patients without contraindications, potentially increased to twice daily for microvascular symptoms. Low-risk patients receive observation with monitoring every 1-3 months. High/intermediate risk patients receive hydroxyurea as first-line treatment (contraindicated in pregnancy), with peginterferon alfa-2a as an alternative for child-bearing population. For hydroxyurea intolerance (defined by difficult-to-control thrombocytosis, anemia, fevers, rash, ankle ulcers, vasomotor symptoms, worsening splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, or persistent cytopenia), anagrelide is recommended after baseline cardiac evaluation (contraindicated with hypokalemia, long QT syndrome, or in pregnancy). Hydroxyurea unresponsiveness is managed with combination anagrelide+hydroxyurea. Ruxolitinib serves as third-line therapy for further disease progression or therapy intolerance. Disease progression indicators requiring reassessment include new thrombosis, significant bleeding, or uncontrolled ET-related symptoms.",
