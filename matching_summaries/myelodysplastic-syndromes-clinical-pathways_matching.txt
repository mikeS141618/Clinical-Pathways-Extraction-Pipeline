PATHWAY: myelodysplastic-syndromes-clinical-pathways

Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) pathway requires diagnostic confirmation via complete blood count with differential, bone marrow biopsy and aspirate, flow cytometry, iron studies, and karyotype analysis. Diagnostic categories include RA/RS, RCMD, RAEB, CMML, RARS, RCMD-RS, RAEB-t, 5q-, and unclassified MDS. Risk stratification uses IPSS/IPSS-R scoring, categorizing patients as high-risk, low-risk, or isolated anemia. Molecular testing includes bone marrow karyotype, with conditional FISH testing for -5/5q, -7/7q, +8, and del(20q) when karyotype is inadequate. Somatic NGS testing targets specific genes including TP53, KMT2A, FLT3, SF3B1, NPM1, RUNX1, NRAS, ETV6, IDH2, CBL, EZH2, U2AF1, SRSF2, DNMT3A, ASXL1, and KRAS. Transplant eligibility assessment considers age <75 years, ECOG PS 0-1, and comorbidities. High-risk MDS treatment includes allogeneic stem cell transplant for eligible patients or hypomethylating agents (decitabine or azacitidine for 4-6 cycles) for ineligible patients. Low-risk MDS with del(5q) is treated with lenalidomide for 3-4 months. Isolated anemia management depends on serum erythropoietin (sEPO) levels: ESAs for sEPO <500 for 8-12 weeks, alternative approaches for sEPO >500. Ring sideroblast presence guides specific management. Supportive care includes iron chelation for patients with >20 packed RBC units transfused. Response assessment requires regular bone marrow biopsy, peripheral blood counts, and monitoring for progression to AML.
