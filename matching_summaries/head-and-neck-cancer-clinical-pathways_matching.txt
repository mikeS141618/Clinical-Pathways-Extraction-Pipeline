PATHWAY: head-and-neck-cancer-clinical-pathways

Head and neck cancer pathway eligibility requires tumor site identification (oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, nasopharynx), TNM staging (T1-4, N0-3, M0-1), and specific biomarker testing. Required molecular testing includes P16 IHC for HPV status in oropharyngeal cancer, ISH for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) and IHC for LMP1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and unknown primary, PD-L1 clone 22C3 with CPS score for metastatic/recurrent disease, and DPYD testing before fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Treatment eligibility depends on ECOG PS 0-1 assessment, cisplatin candidacy, and presence of adverse pathological features (extranodal extension, positive/close margins, pT3-4 tumors, pN2-3 disease, nodal disease in levels IV/V, perineural/perivascular/lymphatic invasion). Treatment modalities include surgical resection with nodal basin dissection, radiation therapy, cisplatin with radiation, cetuximab with radiation, induction chemotherapy, and total or partial laryngectomy. Post-surgical pathways depend on margin status and adverse features. For metastatic/recurrent disease, treatment selection depends on PD-L1 CPS score and platinum eligibility. Special considerations apply to unknown primary tumors requiring HPV/EBV testing, direct laryngoscopy with biopsy, and tonsillectomy. Gulf War and Post 9/11 Veterans with head/neck cancer who served in designated locations during specified periods qualify for presumptive service connection.
