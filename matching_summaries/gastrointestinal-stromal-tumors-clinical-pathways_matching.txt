PATHWAY: gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-clinical-pathways

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are diagnosed through CT scan and/or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy, requiring molecular testing for KIT and PDGFRA mutations using tumor tissue. Risk stratification depends on tumor size (cm), mitotic index (per 50 HPFs), and anatomic location (gastric, duodenum, jejunum/ileum, rectum). Specific mutations guide treatment selection: KIT mutations, PDGFRA mutations (particularly D842V), BRAF V600E, NTRK gene fusions, and SDH deficiency. Treatment pathways include surgical resection for localized disease, with adjuvant imatinib for high-risk features post-resection for minimum 3 years. Potentially unresectable disease may receive neoadjuvant imatinib, with higher doses for KIT exon 9 mutations, sunitinib for imatinib intolerance, and avapritinib for PDGFRA D842V mutations. For metastatic disease, first-line treatments vary by mutation: sunitinib for KIT mutations, imatinib for PDGFRA mutations (except D842V), avapritinib for PDGFRA exon 18 D842V mutation, dabrafenib/trametinib for BRAF V600E, entrectinib for NTRK fusions, and sunitinib for SDH-deficient tumors. Second-line options include regorafenib (KIT), avapritinib (PDGFRA), and pazopanib (SDH-deficient), with ripretinib as a subsequent option for KIT mutations. Surveillance for localized disease involves CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast every 6 months for 5 years then annually, while metastatic disease requires imaging every 3-6 months. Small gastric lesions <2cm may be observed rather than immediately resected. Recurrence risk assessment considers tumor size, mitotic index, and anatomic location, with high-risk features warranting adjuvant therapy.
