PATHWAY: polycythemia-vera-clinical-pathways

Polycythemia Vera (PV) pathway requires diagnosis via bone marrow biopsy and/or peripheral blood testing, with specific molecular testing for JAK2 V617F mutation with reflex to JAK2 sequencing of exons 12-15. Diagnostic workup includes reticulin staining on bone marrow biopsy, FISH to rule out t(9;22) BCR-ABL1, and bone marrow karyotype. Risk stratification categorizes patients as high risk (age >60 years or history of thrombosis) or low risk (age <60 years and no history of thrombosis). Treatment includes daily aspirin 81mg for all patients without contraindications, with potential increase to twice daily for microvascular symptoms. Low-risk patients receive phlebotomy to maintain hematocrit <45%, while high-risk patients undergo assessment for symptom progression. Disease progression indicators include new thrombosis, thrombocytosis with significant bleeding, uncontrolled PV symptoms (pruritis, erythromelalgia, vasomotor disturbances, splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms), or phlebotomy intolerance. Second-line management for progression includes hydroxyurea with or without phlebotomy. Patients showing progression or intolerance to hydroxyurea should receive ruxolitinib. Progression to myelofibrosis should be suspected with progressive cytopenia, rising white blood cell count, increasing splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, or leukocytosis, requiring bone marrow biopsy and advanced somatic NGS panel testing for genes including ASXL1, BCOR, BCORL, CBL, CUX1, DNMT3A, ETV6, EZH2, FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, KRAS, NPM1, NRAS, PHF6, RAD21, RUNX1, SF3B1, SMC1A, SMC3, SRSF2, STAG2, TET2, TP53, U2AF1, ZRSR2, JAK2, CALR, MPL, SETBP1, ETNK1, PTPN11, and NF1. Hydroxyurea is contraindicated in pregnant patients or those wishing to become pregnant, with peginterferon alfa-2a as an alternative. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant should be considered for patients <60 years with high-risk disease.
