  "matching_summary": "Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) pathway requires diagnosis confirmation via LI-RADS 5 in patients with cirrhosis, high HCC risk, or biopsy. Initial assessment includes liver function tests, portal hypertension evaluation, staging with chest CT, multiphase abdominal imaging, and AFP testing. Treatment decisions depend on presence of extrahepatic disease or macrovascular invasion, resectability, transplant candidacy, and eligibility for curative liver therapy. Patients with Child-Pugh A liver function and advanced disease receive first-line treatment with either atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (if eligible for immunotherapy and bevacizumab), durvalumab-tremelimumab (if immunotherapy eligible but bevacizumab contraindicated), or lenvatinib (if immunotherapy contraindicated). Bevacizumab contraindications include non-healing wounds, recent major surgery, bleeding disorders, GI perforation history, unstable cardiac conditions, or active cocaine use. Second-line therapy follows with immunotherapy if prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor use, tyrosine kinase inhibitor if prior immunotherapy, followed by cabozantinib. Curative options include surgical resection, ablative techniques, SBRT, radiation segmentectomy, or liver transplantation for eligible candidates. Liver-directed therapy is considered when curative options aren't feasible. Transplant eligibility requires patient to be ineligible for surgical resection. Special populations include Vietnam veterans with Agent Orange exposure (primary liver cancer covered) and Gulf War/Post-9/11 veterans with service in specified locations (gastrointestinal cancers including liver covered). No molecular testing is required for standard HCC management.",
