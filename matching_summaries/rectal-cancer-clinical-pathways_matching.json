  "matching_summary": "Rectal cancer pathway applies to malignancies below the virtual line from sacral promontory to upper pubic symphysis. Initial staging requires rectal protocol MRI (preferred) or EUS for T/N staging, and CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for M staging. MMR/MSI testing is mandatory for all patients, with comprehensive genomic profiling for stage IV disease including RAS, BRAF, HER2 (IHC with FISH reflex if IHC 2+), and NTRK fusion assessment. DPYD testing is required before fluoropyrimidine administration. Stage I management depends on high-risk features (poor differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, submucosal invasion >1mm, tumor at cautery margin, tumor budding). Stage II-III pMMR treatment includes radiation assessment (eligibility: cT1-3N1+ or T3N0, no threatened CRM, tumor >5cm from anal verge). Treatment options include short-course RT, chemoRT with 5-FU/capecitabine, mFOLFOX6/CAPOX, or FOLFRINOX for aggressive disease (T4, N2, involved/threatened CRM, low-lying tumors, extramural venous invasion). Stage IV treatment branches by resectability and MMR status. dMMR/MSI-H patients receive pembrolizumab. pMMR treatment is guided by molecular status: RAS/BRAF wild-type receive mFOLFOX6/CAPOX+panitumumab or FOLFIRI+panitumumab; RAS-mutant receive mFOLFOX6/CAPOX\u00b1bevacizumab or FOLFIRI\u00b1bevacizumab. Second-line options include encorafenib+panitumumab (BRAF V600E), larotrectinib (NTRK fusion), trastuzumab+pertuzumab (HER2+/RAS/BRAF wild-type), and adagrasib+cetuximab (KRAS G12C). Contraindications exist for oxaliplatin (neuropathy >grade 1, prior treatment within 12 months), capecitabine (CrCl <30ml/min), and bevacizumab (non-healing wounds, recent surgery, bleeding disorders, uncontrolled hypertension, heart failure).",
