  "matching_summary": "PATHWAY MATCHING CRITERIA: CLL/SLL\n\nDiagnosis requires FISH analysis (chromosomes 13q, 17p, 11q, 12, t(11;14)), TP53 sequencing, IGHV hypermutation status, and CpG-stimulated karyotyping from bone marrow, lymph node, or peripheral blood. Risk stratification uses CLL/SLL IPI Score with unfavorable risk defined by TP53 deletion/mutation and/or unmutated IGHV. Treatment initiation criteria include Hgb <10 g/dL, platelets <100,000/mm\u00b3 (non-immune), B symptoms, or symptomatic adenopathy. First-line options are venetoclax+obinutuzumab (12 cycles) or acalabrutinib (continuous). Relapsed disease requires PET/CT to evaluate transformation and treatment selection based on prior therapy. Post-BTK inhibitor treatment: venetoclax+rituximab (24 cycles); post-venetoclax treatment: acalabrutinib. Multiply relapsed disease requires reassessment of TP53 and IGHV status plus BTK/PLCG2 sequencing. Unfavorable risk patients <65 years may receive allogeneic transplant or CAR T-cell therapy; older patients receive venetoclax+rituximab. Favorable risk patients with prior response >2-3 years receive venetoclax+rituximab or pirtobrutinib; <2-3 years receive pirtobrutinib. Response assessment includes flow cytometry or targeted sequencing with MRD testing. Supportive care includes IVIG for hypogammaglobulinemia, TLS prophylaxis for venetoclax, and HSV/VZV prophylaxis. BTK inhibitors are contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.",
