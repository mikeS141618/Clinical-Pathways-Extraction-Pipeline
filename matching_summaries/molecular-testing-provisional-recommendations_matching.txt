PATHWAY: molecular-testing-provisional-recommendations

This pathway outlines molecular testing recommendations for solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. For cervical carcinoma with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic disease, testing includes PD-L1 IHC (clone 22C3 with CPS scoring), MMR protein IHC (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2), and MSI testing by PCR, with reflex MLH1 promoter hypermethylation testing if MLH1/PMS2 loss is detected. Ovarian cancer testing varies by stage and histology: endometrioid Stage I requires MMR/MSI testing; Stages II-IV of all histologies need MMR IHC and comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). Paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma require germline NGS panel testing. Advanced thyroid carcinoma requires CGP. For hematologic malignancies: ALCL requires ALK, CD30, T-cell markers, and PAX5 IHC, with FISH for TP63/DUSP22 rearrangements if ALK-negative. B-ALL/LBL testing includes flow cytometry with MRD capability, FISH for BCR-ABL1 t(9;22), karyotyping, and BCR-ABL1 quantitative PCR. Burkitt lymphoma requires IHC/flow for CD10, CD19, CD20, CD43, BCL2, BCL6, Ki-67, MYC, TdT, and light chains, plus FISH for MYC fusions. CMML/MDS/MPN requires flow cytometry, FISH for BCR-ABL1, karyotyping, and targeted myeloid NGS panel. Eosinophil-related malignancies need flow cytometry, FISH for BCR-ABL1, karyotyping, and reflex testing based on findings. MPAL requires flow cytometry, FISH for BCR-ABL1/KMT2A/-5/5q/-7/7q, karyotyping, rapid molecular tests (FLT3, IDH2, NPM1), and CGP. Systemic mastocytosis testing includes serum tryptase, IHC for CD117/tryptase/CD2/CD25/CD30, flow cytometry, karyotyping, and KIT D816V mutation testing. T-cell/NK-cell malignancies require subtype-specific IHC/flow panels and often T-cell clonality testing.
