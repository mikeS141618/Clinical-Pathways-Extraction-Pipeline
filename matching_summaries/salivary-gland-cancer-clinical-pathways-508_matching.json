  "matching_summary": "Salivary gland cancer management is stratified by TNM staging (T1-2/N0/M0, T3-4a/N0, T1-4/N+, T4b) and tumor grade (low, intermediate, high). Adenoid cystic carcinoma requires special consideration with extended surveillance beyond 5 years. Primary treatment involves surgical resection of the salivary gland with decisions about neck dissection based on staging. Post-resection management depends on margin status (complete vs. incomplete) and presence of adverse features (neural invasion, multiple positive lymph nodes, extranodal extension, lymphovascular invasion). Radiation therapy is indicated for high/intermediate grade tumors, incomplete resections, or presence of adverse features. For recurrent/metastatic disease, molecular testing is essential, including NGS (preferably Tempus or Foundation Medicine), HER2 testing by IHC with FISH for 2+ results, NTRK gene fusion analysis, MSI status, and Androgen Receptor (AR) testing. Treatment selection for advanced disease is biomarker-driven: HER2-positive patients receive trastuzumab biosimilar, AR-positive receive leuprolide (or abiraterone), MSI-High receive pembrolizumab, and NTRK fusion-positive receive entrectinib. For biomarker-negative disease, adenoid cystic histology is treated with lenvatinib, while other histologies receive cisplatin/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (ECOG 0, requires baseline LVEF assessment) or carboplatin/paclitaxel (ECOG 1-2). Presumptive service connection applies to Atomic Veterans with salivary gland cancer and Gulf War/Post-9/11 Veterans with salivary gland-type tumors of lung and trachea who served in specific locations (Afghanistan, Djibouti, Syria, Uzbekistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, Oman).",
