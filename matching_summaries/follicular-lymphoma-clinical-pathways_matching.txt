PATHWAY: follicular-lymphoma-clinical-pathways

Follicular lymphoma (FL) requires excisional lymph node biopsy for diagnosis with grade determination (1-3a follows FL pathway, 3b follows DLBCL pathway). Essential diagnostic workup includes CBC with differential, CMP, uric acid, LDH, hepatitis testing (HBsAg, HBcAb, HBsAb, HCV antibody), HIV testing, and cross-sectional imaging (CT neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast or FDG-PET/CT). Disease staging determines treatment: limited stage (I or contiguous II) may receive radiation therapy (24-30 Gy) or observation, while advanced stage requires assessment for treatment indications including nodal symptoms, organ dysfunction, B-symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats), cytopenias (Hgb <10 g/dL, platelets <100,000/mmÂ³), or disease progression. First-line therapy for advanced disease includes lenalidomide+rituximab (18 cycles) or bendamustine+obinutuzumab (6 cycles), with optional rituximab maintenance every 8 weeks for 24 months. At first relapse, treatment options depend on prior therapy and include bendamustine+rituximab, lenalidomide+rituximab, PI3K inhibitors (idelalisib, copanlisib, duvelisib), radioimmunotherapy, or EZH2 inhibitors for patients with EZH2 mutations. For multiply relapsed disease, transformation assessment is mandatory; if transformation is absent, treatment depends on prior therapy intensity and whether the lymphoma is unfavorable (defined as relapse after anti-CD20, chemotherapy, and lenalidomide OR progression <24 months from all treatments). Cellular therapy candidates (ECOG 0-1, controlled comorbidities, typically <70 years) may receive stem cell transplant or CAR-T therapy. EZH2 mutation testing is recommended for multiply relapsed FL, with tazemetostat for positive cases and zandelisib+obinutuzumab for negative cases. Non-cellular therapy candidates may receive mosunetuzumab. VA presumptive service connection applies to veterans with radiation exposure or service in Southwest Asia theater (post-1990) or specific Middle Eastern/African locations (post-9/11).
