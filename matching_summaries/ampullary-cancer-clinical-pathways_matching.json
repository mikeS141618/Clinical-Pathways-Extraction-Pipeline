  "matching_summary": "Ampullary cancer pathway requires initial diagnosis via biopsy forceps sampling or EUS with FNA/core biopsy for suspicious lesions. Staging includes contrast-enhanced CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis and EUS assessment. Molecular testing includes DPYD testing before fluoropyrimidine therapy, germline NGS panel (BRCA1/2, ERCC5, MEN1, MSH3, CHEK1, TP53, APC, FANCA, ERBB2, RTEL1, HNF1A, PTCH1, ATM, RAD50, MUTYH, Lynch genes), MMR/MSI testing, and comprehensive genomic profiling for advanced disease. HER2 testing via IHC with FISH for IHC 2+ cases is required. Treatment pathways differ by histological subtype: intestinal (CK20+, CDX2+, MUC1-, CK7-) versus pancreaticobiliary/mixed (MUC1+, CK7+, CDX2-, CK20-). For R0 resected intestinal subtype, mFOLFOX6/CAPOX or fluorouracil/capecitabine is used based on oxaliplatin eligibility (ECOG PS 0-1, no prohibitive neuropathy). For R0 resected pancreaticobiliary/mixed subtype, mFOLFIRINOX (if ECOG PS 0-1, no uncontrolled CAD, no prohibitive neuropathy) or gemcitabine/capecitabine is recommended. For stage IV/unresectable pancreaticobiliary/mixed subtype, first-line options include mFOLFIRINOX or nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine. For stage IV intestinal subtype, mFOLFOX6/CAPOX \u00b1 bevacizumab or FOLFIRI \u00b1 bevacizumab is used. Second-line treatments include fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki for HER2 IHC 3+, pembrolizumab for dMMR, FOLFIRI \u00b1 bevacizumab after oxaliplatin, or mFOLFOX6/CAPOX \u00b1 bevacizumab after irinotecan. Bevacizumab requires ECOG PS 0-2, ANC >1500/mm\u00b3, and absence of non-healing wounds, recent surgery, bleeding disorders, GI perforation, unstable cardiac conditions, or active cocaine use. Capecitabine is contraindicated with adherence issues, inability to self-report toxicity, or severe renal impairment (CrCl <30ml/min).",
