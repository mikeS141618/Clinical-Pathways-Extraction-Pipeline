PATHWAY: chronic-myeloid-leukemia-clinical-pathways

Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) pathway requires Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) detection via FISH analysis and BCR-ABL1 fusion gene identification through quantitative PCR. Bone marrow karyotyping is essential for complete diagnosis and phase classification. Disease is categorized into three phases: Chronic Phase (CP) with <10% blasts, Accelerated Phase (AP) with 10-19% blasts or accelerated cytogenetic abnormalities (trisomy 8, isochromosome 17, trisomy 19, complex karyotype), and Blast Phase (BP) with ≥20% blasts or extramedullary myeloid sarcoma. Treatment selection depends on phase classification with imatinib as first-line for CP and dasatinib for AP. Response monitoring requires BCR-ABL1 PCR testing every 3 months with specific response thresholds: optimal response (≤0.1% BCR-ABL1 IS/MR3), provisional sensitive (>0.1-1%), possible resistance (>1-10%), and resistance (>10%) at defined timepoints. Management changes based on BCR-ABL1 levels and kinase domain mutation analysis. T315I mutation requires ponatinib or asciminib. TKI discontinuation eligibility requires ≥3 years continuous therapy, stable MR4 (BCR-ABL1 <0.01% IS) for ≥2 years documented on ≥4 tests performed ≥3 months apart, and no history of advanced CML. Monitoring after discontinuation follows strict protocol with resumption of TKI if MR3 is lost (BCR-ABL1 ≥0.1% IS). Hydroxyurea is used for initial cytoreduction when WBC >50,000/mm³. TKIs are contraindicated during pregnancy. Stem cell transplant evaluation is indicated for patients with inadequate response, resistance to multiple TKIs, or TKI intolerance.
