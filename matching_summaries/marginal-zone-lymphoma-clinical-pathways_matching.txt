PATHWAY: marginal-zone-lymphoma-clinical-pathways

Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) pathway applies to patients with confirmed B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma classified as nodal MZL, splenic MZL, or extranodal MZL of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Diagnosis requires excisional biopsy with flow cytometry or IHC showing CD5, CD10, CD103, CD200, CD11c, CD25, CD23, BCL2, BCL6, cyclin D1, and Ki-67 markers. Molecular testing includes FISH for t(11;14) to exclude mantle cell lymphoma, MALT1 break apart, and MYD88 mutation testing to rule out lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Staging requires CT or PET/CT of neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and bone marrow biopsy. Hepatitis B/C screening is mandatory before anti-CD20 therapy. Treatment varies by subtype and stage: Stage I or contiguous Stage II nodal MZL receives ISRT (24 Gy); advanced nodal MZL with symptoms, cytopenias, or progression receives bendamustine-rituximab (6 cycles). Splenic MZL with symptoms or cytopenias receives rituximab (weekly for 4-8 weeks). Localized cutaneous MALT receives radiation (24 Gy); non-cutaneous localized MALT receives radiation (2 Gy × 2); gastric MALT requires H. pylori testing with eradication therapy if positive, or radiation (24 Gy) if negative. Advanced MALT with symptoms receives bendamustine-rituximab. Relapsed/refractory disease management depends on prior therapy: rituximab for prior non-systemic therapy; zandelisib or bendamustine-rituximab for prior anti-CD20 therapy with response ≤2 years; and zandelisib for chemo-immunotherapy with response ≤2 years. Transformation cases may require stem cell transplant or CAR T therapy. Veterans with MZL may qualify for presumptive service connection if exposed to ionizing radiation, Agent Orange, or served in specific post-9/11 locations.
