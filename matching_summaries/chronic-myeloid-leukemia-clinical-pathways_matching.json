  "matching_summary": "Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) pathway requires Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) detection via FISH analysis and BCR-ABL1 fusion gene identification through quantitative PCR. Bone marrow karyotyping is essential for complete diagnosis and phase classification. Disease is categorized into three phases: Chronic Phase (CP) with <10% blasts, Accelerated Phase (AP) with 10-19% blasts or accelerated cytogenetic abnormalities (trisomy 8, isochromosome 17, trisomy 19, complex karyotype), and Blast Phase (BP) with \u226520% blasts or extramedullary myeloid sarcoma. Treatment selection depends on phase classification with imatinib as first-line for CP and dasatinib for AP. Response monitoring requires BCR-ABL1 PCR testing every 3 months with specific response thresholds: optimal response (\u22640.1% BCR-ABL1 IS/MR3), provisional sensitive (>0.1-1%), possible resistance (>1-10%), and resistance (>10%) at defined timepoints. Management changes based on BCR-ABL1 levels and kinase domain mutation analysis. T315I mutation requires ponatinib or asciminib. TKI discontinuation eligibility requires \u22653 years continuous therapy, stable MR4 (BCR-ABL1 <0.01% IS) for \u22652 years documented on \u22654 tests performed \u22653 months apart, and no history of advanced CML. Monitoring after discontinuation follows strict protocol with resumption of TKI if MR3 is lost (BCR-ABL1 \u22650.1% IS). Hydroxyurea is used for initial cytoreduction when WBC >50,000/mm\u00b3. TKIs are contraindicated during pregnancy. Stem cell transplant evaluation is indicated for patients with inadequate response, resistance to multiple TKIs, or TKI intolerance.",
