PATHWAY: lung-carcinoids-clinical-pathways-508

Lung carcinoid tumors require chest CT with contrast for initial diagnosis, with DOTA-TATE PET/CT preferred for optimal staging (FBS/FDG PET acceptable if DOTA-TATE unavailable). Disease is classified as localized (resectable Stage I-III) or advanced (unresectable/metastatic, including T4/N2 or T4/N3 disease). No molecular testing is currently required for standard prognostication or therapy selection. For resectable disease, surgical resection with lymph node sampling (minimum >3 mediastinal and â‰¥1 hilar station) is standard, with assessment of margin status post-surgery. Patients with positive margins require multidisciplinary discussion, while those with Stage II/A/B and negative margins may receive adjuvant platinum-based regimen (2.5 cycles). Non-surgical candidates may receive radiation therapy. For metastatic/unresectable disease, treatment depends on disease burden and symptom status. Asymptomatic patients with low burden may undergo active surveillance or treatment. First-line therapy for symptomatic or higher burden disease is octreotide long-acting release or lanreotide. Upon progression, everolimus is indicated. For progression after everolimus, Dotatate-positive patients receive Lutetium Lu-177 dotatate or capecitabine/temozolomide, while Dotatate-negative patients require DPYD testing before capecitabine/temozolomide. Dotatate-negative disease may indicate more aggressive biology requiring FDG-PET evaluation and possibly cytotoxic chemotherapy. DPYD testing is mandatory before capecitabine therapy, with Pharmacogenomics consultation for intermediate/poor metabolizers. Veterans with typical or atypical carcinoid of the lung who served in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Syria, Uzbekistan (Sept. 19, 2001-present) during Persian Gulf War, or Southwest Asia theater (Aug. 2, 1990-present) qualify for presumptive service connection.
