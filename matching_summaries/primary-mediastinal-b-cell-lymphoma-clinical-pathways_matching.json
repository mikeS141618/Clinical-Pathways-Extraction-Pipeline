  "matching_summary": "Primary Mediastinal B-Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) presents with anterior mediastinal mass, with bone marrow involvement rarely observed. Diagnosis requires tissue biopsy with pathology evaluation, Hans algorithm markers (CD10, MUM1, BCL6) for Cell of Origin testing, BCL2 expression assessment, and FISH testing for MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 to exclude high-grade B-cell lymphoma. CD30 testing is needed when considering brentuximab. EBER in-situ hybridization is required. Baseline assessments include CBC, CMP, LDH, uric acid, phosphate, viral screening (Hepatitis B/C, HIV), and cardiac function evaluation (Echocardiogram/MUGA with EF >50% considered good). First-line therapy is DA-REPOCH (Dose-Adjusted Rituximab, Etoposide, Prednisone, Vincristine, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin) for 6 cycles, with ISRT/RT as an alternative for patients unable to tolerate DA-REPOCH. Response assessment uses PET scan with Deauville scoring system (1-5). Deauville 4 responses are common in PMBCL and may not indicate treatment failure. Deauville 5 requires immediate re-biopsy. For relapsed disease confirmed by imaging and biopsy, transplant-eligible patients follow DLBCL Relapsed Second Line pathway with post-transplant RT planning, while non-transplant-eligible patients receive Pembrolizumab. GCSF support is indicated for patients >65 years, with cytopenias at diagnosis, or bone marrow involvement. VZV/HSV prophylaxis is recommended. VA presumptive service connection applies to Atomic Veterans with lymphoma (non-Hodgkin's type), Vietnam Veterans with Agent Orange exposure and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Gulf War/Post-9/11 Veterans with lymphoma of any type who served in specified locations.",
