  "matching_summary": "Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors (GI-NETs) are classified by differentiation (well-differentiated Grade 1/2 vs. poorly differentiated), functionality (hormone-producing vs. non-functional), anatomic site (gastric, pancreatic, duodenal, midgut, hindgut, appendiceal), and stage (localized vs. metastatic). Diagnostic workup includes multiphasic chest/abdominopelvic CT/MRI, SSTR-PET (DOTATATE/DOTATOC) for well-differentiated NETs, FDG-PET for poorly differentiated NETs, and biochemical assessment for functional tumors. DPYD testing is required before fluoropyrimidine therapy. Type 1 gastric NETs require EGD with biopsies, gastric pH, serum gastrin, and vitamin B12 levels. Type 2 gastric NETs are associated with gastrinoma. Type 3 gastric NETs require EUS assessment. Duodenal, midgut, and hindgut NETs require staging with multiphasic imaging, SSTR-PET, and biochemical testing. Appendiceal NETs management depends on tumor size (>2cm vs \u22642cm), margin status, and lymph node involvement. Treatment for metastatic well-differentiated, non-functional NETs includes surgical resection/debulking when appropriate, octreotide LAR or lanreotide (Ki67 \u226425%), chemotherapy with CAPTEM (for Ki67 >25% or vital organ function threat), Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (if eligible: eGFR >30ml/min, adequate liver function, PT <1.5xULN, Hgb >8g/dL, WBC >2000/\u03bcL, platelets >75,000/\u03bcL), everolimus (well-controlled/non-diabetic), or sunitinib (poorly controlled diabetes). Functional NETs receive octreotide LAR or lanreotide with telotristat for refractory diarrhea (stool frequency >4 despite optimized therapy). Poorly differentiated NETs receive carboplatin and etoposide, with CAPTEM or FOLFIRI upon progression. Germline NGS panel testing (MEN1, CDKN1B, NF1, TSC1, TSC2, BRCA2, CHEK2, MUTYH, VHL) is indicated for Type 2 gastric NETs, pancreatic NETs, age <50, multifocal disease, or relevant personal/family history.",
