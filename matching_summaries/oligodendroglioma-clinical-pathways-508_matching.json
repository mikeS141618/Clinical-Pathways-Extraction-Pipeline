  "matching_summary": "Oligodendroglioma is defined by IDH mutation with 1p/19q codeletion. Classification includes Grade 2 (IDH-mutated, 1p/19q codeleted, CDKN2A/B intact) and Grade 3 (IDH-mutated, 1p/19q codeleted, with CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion). Diagnosis requires MRI with/without contrast, followed by maximal safe resection or stereotactic biopsy with post-operative MRI within 24-72 hours. Molecular testing includes IHC for IDH1 R132 mutation, ATRX status, 1p/19q FISH for codeletion, and CDKN2A/B testing. For atypical cases, somatic NGS for comprehensive genomic profiling is performed. Treatment for Grade 2 with KPS \u226570 includes radiation therapy, adjuvant temozolomide, or RT followed by adjuvant therapy. High-risk cases receive adjuvant PCV with RT (Procarbazine 60mg/m\u00b2 days 8-21, CCNU 110mg/m\u00b2 day 1, Vincristine 1.4mg/m\u00b2 days 8/29, six cycles every 6 weeks). Grade 3 treatment with KPS \u226570 includes radiation therapy followed by adjuvant PCV (CCNU 90mg/m\u00b2 day 1, Vincristine 1.5mg/m\u00b2 day 8, Procarbazine 60mg/m\u00b2 days 8-21) or temozolomide (75mg/m\u00b2 during RT, then maintenance). Surveillance for Grade 2 includes MRI every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for years 3-5, then annually; Grade 3 requires MRI every 3 months for 5 years, every 6 months for years 5-10, then annually. Presumptive service connection applies to veterans with documented radiation exposure or service after 9/11/2001 in specified regions or after 8/2/1990 in Southwest Asia theater or Somalia.",
