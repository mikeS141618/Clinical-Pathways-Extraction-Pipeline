PATHWAY: mesothelioma-clinical-pathways

Mesothelioma pathway requires histopathological confirmation with classification into epithelioid, sarcomatoid, or biphasic subtypes. PET/CT imaging is mandatory for all patients. Clinical staging (T1-4, N0-3, M0-1) and ECOG performance status (0-4) assessment determine treatment eligibility. For epithelioid mesothelioma, early stage disease (T1-2, N0, M0) with surgical candidacy may receive pleurodesis followed by pleurectomy if positive, while non-resectable cases receive carboplatin plus pemetrexed for 4 cycles with hemithoracic treatment. Locally advanced epithelioid disease (T3-4 or N1-3, M0) with PS 0-1 receives carboplatin plus pemetrexed for 4 cycles, with or without hemithorax treatment. Metastatic epithelioid disease may qualify for radical pleurectomy if pleura >1cm with local recurrence. For sarcomatoid or biphasic subtypes, first-line treatment is nivolumab plus ipilimumab (maximum 2 years) for PS 0-2, with carboplatin plus pemetrexed upon progression if PS remains 0-2. Hemithorax treatment requires PS 0-2, VATS tolerance, and absence of baseline neuropathy, tinnitus, renal insufficiency, hearing loss, or limited cardiopulmonary function. Pleurodesis candidates must have NO disease, low burden pleural disease, and limited chest wall involvement. Ipilimumab dosing is 1mg/kg every 6 weeks. Alternative therapies when cisplatin is contraindicated include pemetrexed, carboplatin, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, irinotecan, CAP (CYVADIC), weekly MTX or CVD. PS 2+ typically indicates palliative care approach. Comprehensive genomic profiling and PD-L1 expression testing are not routinely recommended, and no molecular testing is currently required for standard prognostication or therapy selection.
