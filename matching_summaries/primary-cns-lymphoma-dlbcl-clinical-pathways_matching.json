  "matching_summary": "Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is characterized by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) histology confined to the CNS compartment. Diagnostic confirmation requires brain MRI with and without contrast (or CT with contrast if MRI contraindicated), full body PET/CT to exclude systemic disease, and pathological confirmation via neurosurgical or stereotactic biopsy demonstrating DLBCL. Additional required assessments include complete ophthalmologic examination, CSF analysis with cytology and flow cytometry for large B-cell lymphoma, serum LDH, HIV testing, hepatitis B status, and testicular ultrasound for males >60 years. Treatment eligibility depends on transplant candidacy based on age, performance status, comorbidities, and organ function. Transplant-eligible patients receive induction therapy with MTR (Methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, Temozolomide, Rituximab), R-MPV (Rituximab, Methotrexate, Procarbazine, Vincristine), or MATRix (Methotrexate, Cytarabine, Thiotepa, Rituximab), followed by response assessment via brain MRI and possibly repeat CSF analysis. Complete or partial responders proceed to high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue. Non-transplant candidates receive MTR induction if eligible for high-dose methotrexate. Contraindications for Rituximab include hepatitis B infection, history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and active fungal infections. Methotrexate dosing requires adjustment based on renal function, with age-adjusted dosing for patients >65 years. PCP prophylaxis is required during high-dose methotrexate induction. Response assessment includes brain MRI evaluation for complete response, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease, which determines subsequent management decisions.",
