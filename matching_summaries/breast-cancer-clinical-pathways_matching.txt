PATHWAY: breast-cancer-clinical-pathways

This breast cancer clinical pathway applies to patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer, including DCIS, invasive, and metastatic disease. Eligibility determination requires ER/PR/HER2 status testing, with HER2 positivity defined as IHC 3+ or FISH showing ≥6.0 HER2 signals/cell or ≥4.0 signals with HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2.0. Triple negative disease is defined as ER-/PR-/HER2-. Staging requires TNM classification with specific management for Stage I-III and Stage IV disease. Biomarker testing includes germline BRCA1/2/PALB2 testing, 21-gene RT-PCR assay (Oncotype DX) for ER+/PR+/HER2- disease with scores >25 indicating chemotherapy benefit, PD-L1 CPS scoring for metastatic triple negative disease with CPS ≥10 qualifying for pembrolizumab, and comprehensive genomic profiling for metastatic disease to identify PIK3CA and ESR1 mutations. Treatment algorithms differ by subtype: ER+/PR+/HER2- patients receive endocrine therapy (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, ovarian suppression) with potential CDK4/6 inhibitors (ribociclib, abemaciclib); HER2+ patients receive anti-HER2 therapies (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, T-DM1, T-DXd); triple negative patients receive chemotherapy (dACT, TC, AC-T) with potential immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) or PARP inhibitors (olaparib) for BRCA-positive cases. Neoadjuvant therapy is indicated for locally advanced disease (≥T2 or N+). Surgical approaches include breast conservation (lumpectomy) or mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy or axillary dissection based on nodal status. Radiation therapy follows breast conservation or is indicated for high-risk post-mastectomy cases (≥T3 or ≥N1). The CPS+EG scoring system (0-6) stratifies risk after neoadjuvant therapy. Special considerations include presumptive service connection for veterans with qualifying exposures and specific monitoring requirements for treatment toxicities.
