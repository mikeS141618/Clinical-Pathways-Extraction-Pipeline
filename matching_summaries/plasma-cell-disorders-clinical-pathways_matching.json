  "matching_summary": "The plasma cell disorders pathway covers MGUS, plasmacytoma, smoldering multiple myeloma, multiple myeloma, and AL amyloidosis. Diagnostic workup includes SPEP with IFE, serum free light chain assay, CBC, comprehensive chemistries (creatinine, calcium, albumin, total protein), bone marrow biopsy with FISH analysis (targeting 17p/TP53, del 13, 1q21, 1p, t(11;14), t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20)), flow cytometry, and karyotyping. MGUS is stratified by immunoglobulin type and monoclonal protein levels. Smoldering myeloma criteria include bone marrow plasma cells >20%, monoclonal protein >2 g/dL, and SFLC ratio >20. Multiple myeloma treatment depends on transplant eligibility, with transplant-eligible patients receiving RVd induction, autologous stem cell transplant, and maintenance therapy (lenalidomide \u00b1 proteasome inhibitor for high-risk). Non-transplant eligible patients receive DRd or RVCd based on performance status. Second-line therapy is determined by refractoriness to lenalidomide and bortezomib, with options including KPd, RCd, DPd, or DKd. For multiply-relapsed disease, penta-refractory (progression within 6 months on lenalidomide, pomalidomide, bortezomib, carfilzomib, anti-CD38 antibody) or triple-class refractory patients may receive anti-BCMA CAR T-cell therapy or teclistamab. Patients with t(11;14) may receive venetoclax-based therapy. AL amyloidosis requires Congo red staining and mass spectroscopy confirmation, with treatment including daratumumab, cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone, followed by transplant if eligible. Supportive care includes bone protective agents (denosumab/pamidronate), thromboprophylaxis with IMiDs, and antiviral prophylaxis with proteasome inhibitors.",
