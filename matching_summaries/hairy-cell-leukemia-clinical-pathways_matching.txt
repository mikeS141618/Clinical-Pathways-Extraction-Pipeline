PATHWAY: hairy-cell-leukemia-clinical-pathways

Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) is a rare chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by abnormal B-lymphocytes with "hairy" cytoplasmic projections. Diagnostic criteria include bone marrow with "fried egg" appearance, bland ground-glass chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and pale cytoplasm with villous projections. Immunophenotypic profile requires bright CD20/CD22 expression, bright surface immunoglobulin, co-expression of CD11c, CD103, CD25, CD123, Annexin-1 positivity, and weak/patchy cyclin D1 expression. BRAF V600E mutation is pathognomonic for classic HCL. Required baseline testing includes CBC with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, hepatitis B/C serology, HIV testing, and bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry. Treatment is indicated with ANC <1000/mm³, hemoglobin <11 g/dL, platelets <100,000/mm³, constitutional symptoms (weight loss, fever, fatigue, night sweats), or symptomatic splenomegaly. First-line treatment is Cladribine 0.14 mg/kg IV daily for 5 days. For relapsed disease, if initial response lasted >24 months, repeat Cladribine; if <24 months, administer Vemurafenib and Rituximab. Supportive care includes PJP and varicella prophylaxis for 12 months post-Cladribine, frequent CBC monitoring for 6 weeks post-therapy, and screening for secondary malignancies. For Rituximab regimens, hepatitis B testing is required with entecavir prescribed if HBsAg or HBcAb positive. Response to Cladribine may take 6-9 months. WHO classification distinguishes classic HCL (BRAF V600E positive) from Splenic B-cell Lymphoma with prominent nucleoli (previously Hairy Cell Variant, BRAF V600E negative). Veterans with HCL and exposure to ionizing radiation may qualify for presumptive disability benefits.
