PATHWAY: kidney-cancer-clinical-pathways

The kidney cancer clinical pathway applies to patients with confirmed or suspected renal malignancies requiring CT abdomen/pelvis, chest x-ray, complete metabolic panel, CBC with differential, lactate dehydrogenase, and urinalysis for initial diagnosis. Staging determines treatment: Stage I T1a tumors (≤4cm) warrant active surveillance, partial nephrectomy, radical nephrectomy, or ablative procedures; T1b tumors (>4cm but ≤7cm) require partial/radical nephrectomy with ablative procedures as alternatives. Stage II management involves partial/radical nephrectomy with adjuvant pembrolizumab eligibility for clear cell carcinoma with nuclear grade 4 or sarcomatoid differentiation. Stage III requires radical nephrectomy followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab. Stage IV or relapsed clear cell disease necessitates risk stratification (favorable, intermediate, poor) based on specific factors: time from diagnosis to therapy (<1 year), performance status <80%, abnormal hemoglobin, calcium, neutrophil, and platelet levels. Treatment options include cytoreductive nephrectomy, metastasis-directed therapy, and systemic therapy with ipilimumab+nivolumab (intermediate/poor risk) or pembrolizumab+axitinib (favorable risk), with cabozantinib as second-line therapy. Surveillance protocols vary by stage: Stage I requires annual H&P and CMP for 5 years with periodic imaging; Stages II/III need more frequent monitoring (every 3-6 months for years 1-3); Stage IV requires monitoring every 6-16 weeks during therapy. Gulf War and Post-9/11 Veterans with service in specific regions (Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Uzbekistan, Yemen, Southwest Asia, Somalia) after specified dates may qualify for presumptive service connection. Genetic counseling is indicated for patients with multiple/bilateral masses, family history, or young-onset disease.
