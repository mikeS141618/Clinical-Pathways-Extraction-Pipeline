  "matching_summary": "Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) diagnosis requires tissue evaluation with immunophenotyping for CD3, CD5, CD20, cyclin D1, SOX11, Ki-67 (prognostic cutoff 30%), TP53 mutation testing, and FISH for t(11;14) IGH::CCND1 and del 17p. Baseline testing includes HIV, Hepatitis B serology, LDH, uric acid, CBC with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, PET scan, bone marrow biopsy, with endoscopy for GI symptoms/anemia and lumbar puncture for CNS symptoms. MCL is classified as indolent (leukemic/non-nodal, Ki-67 <10%, SOX11 negative, CD5+, cyclin D1+) or classical/aggressive (nodal presentation, Ki-67 often >30%, blastoid variant has poor prognosis). Stage I/contiguous Stage II receives bendamustine/rituximab with radiation (30 Gy). For indolent MCL, observation is indicated unless anemia (Hgb <10 g/dL), platelets <100,000/mm\u00b3, non-immune cytopenias, B-symptoms, or symptomatic adenopathy develop. Classical/aggressive MCL treatment includes RDHAP/RCHOP (LYMA regimen) or bendamustine/rituximab, followed by rituximab maintenance for responsive disease. Relapsed/refractory MCL options include CAR T-cell therapy, autologous stem cell transplantation, acalabrutinib, or bendamustine/rituximab if prior response >24 months. For covalent BTKi-refractory cases, options include lenalidomide/rituximab, bortezomib/rituximab, or pirtobrutinib. TP53 mutations/del(17p) indicate poor prognosis requiring novel agents. Hepatitis B screening is mandatory before rituximab, with prophylactic entecavir for HBsAg or HBcAb positive patients. Veterans with MCL may qualify for presumptive service connection with documented ionizing radiation exposure or service in specific regions after August 2, 1990 or September 11, 2001.",
