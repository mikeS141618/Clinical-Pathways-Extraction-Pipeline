PATHWAY: gastric-cancer-clinical-pathways

Gastric cancer pathway requires initial anatomic location assessment distinguishing GE junction tumors (classified by Siewert system: 1-2 follow esophageal pathways, 3 treated as gastric) from true gastric cancers. Staging includes CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast and/or PET/CT, endoscopic ultrasound for non-metastatic disease, and staging laparoscopy with peritoneal lavage for T3/N+/M0 cases. Molecular testing includes MMR/MSI status for all patients, with HER2 status (IHC with FISH reflex if IHC 2+) and PD-L1 testing (clone 22C3 with CPS score) for advanced disease. Treatment pathways are determined by TNM staging: T1N0M0 may receive EMR/ESD if eligible; T2+ or N+/M0 requires FLOT4 (if ECOG PS 0-1) or mFOLFOX6/CAPOX followed by gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy; unresectable/metastatic disease treatment varies by molecular profile. For MSS HER2+ disease, first-line options include trastuzumab with pembrolizumab plus CAPOX/mFOLFOX6 (if PD-L1 CPS ≥1%) or trastuzumab with chemotherapy alone; second-line includes fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan or paclitaxel+ramucirumab. For MSS HER2- disease, first-line is nivolumab+chemotherapy (if PD-L1 CPS ≥1%) or chemotherapy alone; second-line is paclitaxel+ramucirumab. MSI-H patients receive nivolumab+chemotherapy or pembrolizumab monotherapy. DPYD testing is required before fluoropyrimidine administration. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are contraindicated with active autoimmune disease, primary immune deficiency, concurrent immunosuppression, or prior transplantation. Capecitabine is avoided in patients with medication adherence issues, inability to self-report toxicity, or severe renal impairment (CrCl <30ml/min).
