  "matching_summary": "Esophageal cancer pathway encompasses adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma management across stages. Molecular testing requirements include MSI/MMR status (PCR or IHC), HER2 testing (IHC with FISH reflex if 2+), PD-L1 by CPS, and CLDN18 by IHC (\u226575% moderate-to-strong membranous staining) for stage IVB adenocarcinoma; PD-L1 by CPS for stage IVB squamous cell carcinoma. Germline NGS testing indicated for MMR-deficient/MSI-H tumors. Disease staging follows TNM classification: Stage IA (T1aN0M0), Stage I (T1bN0M0), locally advanced (T1N1[IIA] to T1-3N3[IVA]), and metastatic (IVB). High-risk features include lymphovascular invasion, poorly differentiated tumors, tumor size \u22652cm, SM1/SM2 involvement, and positive EMR margins. Treatment pathways vary by histology, stage, and biomarker status: EMR/ESD for Stage IA; surgical resection for Stage I surgical candidates; FLOT4 or mFOLFOX6 preoperatively for surgical adenocarcinoma candidates; carboplatin/paclitaxel with radiation for non-surgical candidates or squamous histology. For metastatic disease, treatment selection depends on MSI status, HER2 status (positive: trastuzumab-based regimens; negative: consider CLDN18.2 status), PD-L1 CPS score (<1, 1-4, \u22655, \u226510), and ECOG status. Key medications include FLOT4, mFOLFOX6, CAPOX, carboplatin, paclitaxel, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, trastuzumab, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan, zolbetuximab, ramucirumab, irinotecan, and docetaxel. DPYD testing required before fluoropyrimidine therapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitor contraindications include active autoimmune disease, primary immune deficiency, concurrent immunosuppression, and prior allogeneic HSCT/solid organ transplant. Trastuzumab requires HER2-positive disease and LVEF \u226550%. Ramucirumab eligibility requires prior fluoropyrimidine/platinum treatment, ECOG PS 0-2, and ANC \u22651500/mm\u00b3.",
