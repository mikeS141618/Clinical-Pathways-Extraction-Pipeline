PATHWAY: lung-cancer-clinical-pathways

This clinical pathway applies to patients with suspected or confirmed lung cancer, requiring initial assessment with PET/CT for suspicious pulmonary nodules. For diagnosis, EBUS examination of paratracheal/hilar stations with sampling of nodes >0.5cm is performed, with brain MRIs for Stage II and above. The pathway distinguishes between Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC). For NSCLC, management varies by stage: Stage IA requires surgical resection with lymph node sampling; Stage IB requires lobectomy with node sampling; Stages IIA/IIB/IIIA require lobectomy with node sampling plus adjuvant therapy based on histology. Molecular testing is essential, including PD-L1 expression (using 22C3 antibody) and Comprehensive Genomic Profiling for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, RET, MET, BRAF, KRAS, NTRK1/2/3, and HER2 mutations. Treatment decisions depend on specific mutations: EGFR Exon 19 Del/L858R (Osimertinib), EML4-ALK Fusion (Alectinib), KRAS G12C (Sotorasib), MET Exon 14 Skipping (Capmatinib), BRAF V600E (Dabrafenib/trametinib), RET Rearrangement (Selpercatinib), ROS1 Fusion (Entrectinib), and NTRK Fusion (Entrectinib). For metastatic disease without actionable mutations, treatment depends on PD-L1 status: PD-L1 0-49% receives Pembrolizumab/carboplatin/pemetrexed; PD-L1 â‰¥50% receives Pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy. For SCLC, treatment differs between Limited Stage (cisplatin/etoposide with concurrent radiation followed by Durvalumab) and Extensive Stage (carboplatin/etoposide with atezolizumab). Relapsed SCLC treatment depends on time to progression: >6 months receives carboplatin/etoposide; <6 months receives Lurbinectedin. Surveillance protocols include CT chest every 6 months for years 1-2 post-surgery, then annually. Special considerations exist for VA Presumptive Service Connection for veterans with Agent Orange exposure, ionizing radiation exposure, or qualifying Gulf War/Post-9/11 service.
