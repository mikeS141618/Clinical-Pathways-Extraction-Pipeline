  "matching_summary": "Colon cancer pathway requires staging (I-IV) and molecular testing including MMR/MSI status for all patients, with comprehensive genomic profiling for stage IV including RAS, BRAF, HER2, NTRK, and KRAS G12C mutations. DPYD testing is mandatory before fluoropyrimidine therapy. Stage I management involves assessment for high-risk features in malignant polyps (poor differentiation, LVI, submucosal invasion >1mm, positive margins, tumor budding). Stage II requires risk stratification based on obstruction, perforation, differentiation, lymphovascular/perineural invasion, lymph node harvest <12, margin status, and tumor budding. Stage III treatment depends on risk level (T4/N2 vs T1-3/N1) and MMR status. Stage IV management is determined by resectability and molecular profile. For dMMR/MSI-H patients, pembrolizumab is first-line for unresectable disease. For pMMR/MSS patients, treatment options include mFOLFOX6/CAPOX, FOLFIRI with targeted agents based on molecular status: panitumumab for RASwt/BRAFwt left-sided tumors, bevacizumab for RASmut/BRAFwt, encorafenib+panitumumab for BRAF V600E, larotrectinib for NTRK fusions, trastuzumab+pertuzumab for HER2 overexpression/ERBB2 amplification, adagrasib+cetuximab for KRAS G12C mutations, and trifluridine-tipiracil or fruquintinib in later lines. Specific contraindications include oxaliplatin avoidance with neuropathy >grade 1, capecitabine avoidance with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30ml/min), and bevacizumab contraindications including non-healing wounds, recent surgery, bleeding disorders, GI perforation history, unstable cardiac conditions, uncontrolled hypertension, or active cocaine use.",
