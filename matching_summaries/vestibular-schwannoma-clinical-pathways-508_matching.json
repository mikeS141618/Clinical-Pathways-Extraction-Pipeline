  "matching_summary": "Vestibular schwannoma is a benign tumor developing on the vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve, requiring brain MRI with dedicated internal auditory canal sequences for diagnosis. Patients are stratified based on neurologic symptom presence and NF2 (Neurofibromatosis type 2) status. NF2-related bilateral schwannomatosis cases require direct referral to Neuro-oncology through National TeleOncology. Symptomatic patients require immediate referrals to Neurosurgery and Radiation Oncology, with Otolaryngology consultation as needed, followed by multidisciplinary treatment planning through local tumor board or National TeleOncology CNS Virtual Tumor Board. Treatment decisions consider tumor size, location, growth rate, and symptom severity. Asymptomatic patients follow a surveillance protocol consisting of annual audiometry and brain MRI for 10 years, transitioning to every 3-5 years if stable. Progression indicators include tumor growth or new hearing loss, triggering specialist referrals. Comprehensive monitoring includes serial MRI with internal auditory canal protocol, audiometric testing, vestibular function assessment, and cranial nerve assessment. The condition is not a VA presumptive condition, requiring standard disability claim processes for service connection. Clinical trial participation should be considered throughout management, with navigation assistance available through CancerClinicalTrialsNavigation@va.gov. Quality metrics include time to specialist evaluation, surveillance protocol adherence, multidisciplinary discussion documentation, and patient-reported outcomes.",
