  "matching_summary": "Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) pathway requires diagnostic confirmation via flow cytometry, FISH testing for translocations t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17), BCR-ABL1, and TP53, conventional karyotyping, and molecular testing for FLT3 (ITD and TKD), IDH1/2, NPM1, and CEBPA mutations. Risk stratification depends on cytogenetic findings (favorable, intermediate, poor/adverse) and mutation status. Treatment pathways diverge based on FLT3 mutation status and intensive therapy candidacy. FLT3-mutated AML requires cytarabine+daunorubicin/idarubicin+midostaurin induction followed by HiDAC+midostaurin or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. FLT3 wild-type AML with favorable cytogenetics receives cytarabine+daunorubicin/idarubicin followed by HiDAC or FLAG-IDA. Intermediate cytogenetics cases receive similar induction with consolidation options including HiDAC, FLAG-IDA, or transplant. Poor/adverse cytogenetics cases prioritize transplantation post-induction. Therapy-related AML, MDS-AML, or complex cytogenetics receive CPX-351 (liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin) or standard \"7+3\" regimen. Non-intensive candidates receive decitabine+venetoclax, low-dose cytarabine+venetoclax, or azacitidine+venetoclax. Relapsed/refractory disease management depends on prior transplant status and molecular subtype, with targeted therapies for specific mutations: ivosidenib (IDH1), enasidenib (IDH2), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (CD33+), and gilteritinib (FLT3). Response assessment requires bone marrow biopsy with complete remission defined as <5% blasts, no extramedullary disease, ANC >1,000/\u03bcL, platelets >100,000/\u03bcL, and transfusion independence.",
