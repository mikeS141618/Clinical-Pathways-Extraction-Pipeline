PATHWAY: malignant-melanoma-clinical-pathways-508

Cutaneous melanoma diagnosis requires Breslow depth assessment with staging (0-IV) determining management. T1a (≤1mm) requires wide local excision with 1cm margins; T1b (≤1mm with ulceration/mitoses) needs excision plus consideration of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB); melanomas >1-2mm require 1-2cm margins plus SLNB; ≥2mm requires 2cm margins plus SLNB. BRAF V600E/K mutation testing is mandatory for Stage III-IV disease. Stage IA/IB (T1a-T2a, N0) requires dermatologic surveillance without routine imaging. Stage IB-IIC (T2b-T4b, N0) may receive adjuvant pembrolizumab for 1 year. Stage III treatment depends on nodal status: SLN+ patients receive pembrolizumab (if immunotherapy eligible) or dabrafenib/trametinib (if BRAF+); clinically positive nodes may receive neoadjuvant nivolumab. Metastatic disease treatment depends on resectability, immunotherapy candidacy, and BRAF status: options include ipilimumab/nivolumab, nivolumab/relatlimab, pembrolizumab, or dabrafenib/trametinib (BRAF+). Special anatomical variants require specific testing: mucosal melanoma needs KIT mutation testing; ocular melanoma requires gene expression profiling and HLA-A*02:01 testing for metastatic disease (tebentafusp-tebn for HLA-A*02:01+ patients). Immunotherapy contraindications include active autoimmune disease, primary immune deficiency, concurrent immunosuppression (prednisone >10mg/day), prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation, or solid organ transplant. Surveillance imaging frequency varies by stage: none for Stage 0-IB; every 3-12 months for Stage IB-IIC for 2 years then every 6-12 months for 3 years; every 6-12 months for Stage IIIA/IIIB; every 3-12 months for Stage IIIC/IIID/IV.
