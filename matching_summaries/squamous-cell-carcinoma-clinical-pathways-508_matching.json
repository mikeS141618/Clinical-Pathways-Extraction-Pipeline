  "matching_summary": "The clinical pathway for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) applies to patients with confirmed SCC diagnosis who are not candidates for definitive local treatment (medical, surgical, or radiation) as determined by multidisciplinary tumor board evaluation. Service-connected presumptive conditions include SCC of the larynx and trachea for veterans with qualifying service history in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Syria, Uzbekistan during Persian Gulf War (Sept. 19, 2001-present) or Southwest Asia theater operations (Aug. 2, 1990-present). First-line treatment follows a decision algorithm starting with immunotherapy candidacy assessment; eligible patients receive Cemiplimab while those with contraindications (active autoimmune disease, primary immune deficiency, concurrent immunosuppression including prednisone >10mg/day, prior allogeneic stem cell/solid organ transplantation) proceed to chemotherapy evaluation. Chemotherapy-eligible patients receive Carboplatin and Paclitaxel, while non-candidates receive Cetuximab. Disease progression assessment evaluates number of sites (\u22655 or <5), time to progression, progression rate, and location. Second-line treatment for patients with \u22655 sites of progressive disease depends on prior therapy: patients without prior Cetuximab who are immunotherapy candidates receive Cemiplimab; chemotherapy candidates with no prior carboplatin/paclitaxel receive this regimen; those with prior carboplatin/paclitaxel but no prior Cetuximab receive Cetuximab. Patients with <5 sites of progressive disease are referred to Palliative Care. No molecular testing is currently required for standard prognostication or therapy selection in SCC, with treatment decisions based on conventional clinical and histopathological assessment. Clinical trial eligibility should be assessed at all decision points, with multidisciplinary discussion recommended for complex cases or when standard options are exhausted.",
