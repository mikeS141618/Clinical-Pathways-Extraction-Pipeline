PATHWAY: waldenstrom-macroglobulemia-clinical-pathways

Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma (WM/LPL) is diagnosed by the presence of IgM monoclonal gammopathy in serum and bone marrow/lymph node biopsy showing lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltration. MYD88 mutations support but aren't required for diagnosis, while CXCR4 mutations in MYD88-mutated LPL indicate negative prognosis. Required diagnostic testing includes complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic profile, HIV/hepatitis B and C testing, LDH/uric acid levels, CT scans of chest/abdomen/pelvis, quantitative immunoglobulins, and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation. Molecular testing should include targeted sequencing for MYD88 and CXCR4 mutations from bone marrow, lymph node, or blood specimens. Treatment is indicated for patients with anemia, bleeding, hyperviscosity, symptomatic adenopathy/organomegaly, or WM-related peripheral neuropathy. First-line therapy includes rituximab monotherapy for mild anemia (Hgb â‰¥10 g/dL) or symptomatic cryoglobulinemia, while bendamustine plus rituximab is used for bulky lymphadenopathy, Hgb <10 g/dL, hyperviscosity after plasmapheresis, constitutional symptoms, or IgM-related peripheral neuropathy. Hyperviscosity symptoms require urgent plasmapheresis followed by systemic therapy, with caution using rituximab due to potential IgM flare. For relapsed disease, treatment options include zanubrutinib or bendamustine plus rituximab after prior rituximab therapy; zanubrutinib after prior chemoimmunotherapy; bendamustine plus rituximab after prior BTK inhibitor therapy; and zanubrutinib or bendamustine plus rituximab after prior bortezomib-containing regimens. For multiply relapsed disease refractory to BTK inhibitors, bendamustine, and bortezomib, venetoclax may be considered. Veterans with WM/LPL may qualify for presumptive service connection if they were exposed to ionizing radiation, Agent Orange, or served in specific post-9/11 or Gulf War locations.
