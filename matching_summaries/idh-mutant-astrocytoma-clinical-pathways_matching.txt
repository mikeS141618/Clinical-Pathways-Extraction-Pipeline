PATHWAY: idh-mutant-astrocytoma-clinical-pathways

IDH Mutant Astrocytoma pathway requires initial intracranial imaging suspicious for glioma followed by maximal safe resection or biopsy with post-resection MRI within 72 hours. Molecular testing includes IDH and ATRX immunohistochemistry, with positive IDH mutation cases requiring FISH testing for 1p/19q codeletion and CDKN2A/B homozygous loss, plus TERT promoter mutation testing. Classification criteria: IDH mutant with ATRX loss indicates Astrocytoma WHO Grade 2; IDH mutant with ATRX retained and 1p/19q intact indicates Astrocytoma WHO Grade 4; IDH mutant with ATRX retained and 1p/19q co-deleted with CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion indicates Oligodendroglioma WHO Grade 3, while intact or single copy deletion indicates Grade 2. Treatment for Grade 2 astrocytoma depends on risk stratification: high-risk features (age >40 with residual tumor, neurologic symptoms, contrast enhancement) require radiation therapy followed by temozolomide or PCV if KPS >60. Grade 3 with KPS ≥70 receives radiation therapy with consideration for adjuvant temozolomide. Grade 4 with KPS ≥70 receives temozolomide 75mg/m²/day for 42 days with concurrent radiation, followed by adjuvant temozolomide 150-200mg/m² days 1-5 of 28-day cycles for 6-12 months if no pseudoprogression. Poor performance status (KPS <70) requires individualized approaches. Surveillance includes MRI 4 weeks post-radiation, then every 3-4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for years 3-5, and annually thereafter. VA presumptive service connection applies to veterans with brain cancer exposed to ionizing radiation or with qualifying service after August 2, 1990 (Southwest Asia, Somalia) or September 11, 2001 (Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Uzbekistan, Yemen).
