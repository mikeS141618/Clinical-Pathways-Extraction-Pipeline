PATHWAY: pancreatic-cancer-clinical-pathways

Pancreatic cancer pathway requires contrast-enhanced CT of chest, abdomen, pelvis with core biopsy of metastatic lesion or EUS with FNA of primary tumor for diagnosis. Disease is categorized as resectable, borderline resectable, locally unresectable (Stage III), or metastatic (Stage IV). Molecular testing includes germline testing (APC, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK4, CDKN2A, EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, PALB2, STK11, TP53) and somatic testing with comprehensive genomic profiling. MMR protein IHC (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) is required. DPYD testing is mandatory before fluoropyrimidine therapy. Treatment varies by stage: resectable disease receives neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX or nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine followed by surgery; borderline resectable receives similar neoadjuvant therapy with reassessment for resectability; unresectable Stage III receives mFOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine-based therapy with possible chemoradiation; Stage IV treatment depends on fitness for combination chemotherapy with mFOLFIRINOX, nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine, or cisplatin+gemcitabine (for BRCA1/2 or PALB2 mutations). Specific molecular subtypes receive targeted therapy: dMMR (pembrolizumab), NTRK fusion (entrectinib), KRAS G12C mutation (adagrasib), BRAF V600E mutations (targeted therapy). Second-line options include mFOLFOX6, FOLFIRI, liposomal irinotecan+5-FU+leucovorin, or gemcitabine-based regimens. Adjuvant therapy post-resection includes 6 months of mFOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine-based therapy. Eligibility for combination chemotherapy requires ECOG PS 0-2, adequate organ function, and ability to maintain oral intake. mFOLFIRINOX eligibility requires ECOG PS 0-1, absence of uncontrolled CAD, and lack of prohibitive neuropathy.
