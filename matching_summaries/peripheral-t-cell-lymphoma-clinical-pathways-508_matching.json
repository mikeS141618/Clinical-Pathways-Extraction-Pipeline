  "matching_summary": "Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) pathway requires excisional biopsy with immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry for diagnosis. Key diagnostic markers include CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD30, and ALK status. PTCL subtypes include PTCL-NOS and ALCL (ALK-positive or ALK-negative). ALCL diagnosis requires assessment of CD30, ALK, and DUSP22 rearrangement (for ALK-negative cases). Required imaging includes PET/CT scan, with cardiac function evaluation via echocardiogram or MUGA (EF >50% considered good). Laboratory testing includes CBC, CMP, LDH, uric acid, phosphorus, Hepatitis B/C, and HIV. First-line treatment for CD30-positive PTCL-NOS is brentuximab vedotin plus CHP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone); CD30-negative cases receive CHOEP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone). ALCL treatment is brentuximab vedotin plus CHP. Post-treatment pathways vary by ALK status, with ALK-negative without DUSP22 rearrangement cases considered for transplant. Relapsed/refractory treatment options include crizotinib (for ALK-positive ALCL), brentuximab vedotin (if not previously used), pralatrexate, or cell therapy referral for transplant candidates. G-CSF support is recommended for patients \u226565 years, those with pre-existing cytopenias, or bone marrow involvement. Radiation therapy may be used for localized disease or palliative care. Presumptive service connection applies to Veterans with radiation exposure, Agent Orange exposure (Vietnam), or service in Southwest Asia theater, Somalia, or specific post-9/11 locations.",
