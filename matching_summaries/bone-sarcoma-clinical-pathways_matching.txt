PATHWAY: bone-sarcoma-clinical-pathways

This bone sarcoma pathway applies to patients with chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, or osteosarcoma confirmed through core needle biopsy with expert pathology review. Initial workup requires X-rays, contrast-enhanced MRI of the primary tumor, and CT chest with contrast. Molecular testing varies by subtype: chondrosarcoma requires DNA/RNA-based genomic profiling for widespread disease; Ewing sarcoma needs FISH or RT-PCR for EWSR1:FLI1 fusion; osteosarcoma requires genomic profiling from non-decalcified tissue in metastatic cases. Chondrosarcoma treatment depends on resectability, with pathology-based classification determining approach (de-differentiated follows osteosarcoma pathway; mesenchymal follows Ewing pathway). For MSI-high/TMB ≥10 recurrent chondrosarcoma, pembrolizumab is indicated; IDH1 mutations warrant ivosidenib. Ewing sarcoma requires VDC/IE chemotherapy (vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide alternating with ifosfamide, etoposide) for 49 weeks, with filgrastim support. Relapsed Ewing cases receive cyclophosphamide/topotecan, followed by regorafenib, then gemcitabine/docetaxel. Osteosarcoma treatment varies by grade: low-grade requires wide excision; high-grade needs neoadjuvant cisplatin/doxorubicin or methotrexate/leucovorin followed by resection. Response assessment uses ≥90% tumor necrosis as threshold for good response. Relapsed osteosarcoma treatment includes etoposide/ifosfamide and regorafenib. Surveillance protocols differ by subtype, with chondrosarcoma requiring CT/MRI of affected area plus CT chest every 6 months for 5 years; Ewing sarcoma needs physical exam, CBC, MRI/CT of primary site, and CT chest every 3 months; osteosarcoma requires X-rays, contrast-enhanced MRI, and CT chest.
