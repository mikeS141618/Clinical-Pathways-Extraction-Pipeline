  "matching_summary": "Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) pathway requires histopathologic confirmation and distinction from nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). Risk stratification for early-stage cHL involves assessment of bulky disease (\u226510 cm or \u226533% thorax), extranodal sites, ESR levels (\u226550 with B symptoms or \u226530 if asymptomatic), and nodal site count. PET/CT using Deauville criteria (5-point scale) is essential for response evaluation. Stage I-II favorable disease receives ABVD chemotherapy (Doxorubicin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine) for 2 cycles followed by radiation therapy (20Gy) if good response (Deauville 1-3). Stage I-II unfavorable disease requires 4 cycles of ABVD with 30Gy radiation. Stage III-IV treatment depends on ECOG Performance Status, with ECOG 0-2 patients receiving Nivolumab plus AVD (Doxorubicin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine). Relapsed disease management is determined by transplant eligibility and immunotherapy candidacy, with options including Pembrolizumab plus GVD (Gemcitabine, Vinorelbine, Liposomal Doxorubicin), GVD alone, Pembrolizumab monotherapy, Bendamustine (for patients with significant neuropathy), or Brentuximab. NLPHL treatment varies by stage: Stage IA/IIA receives radiation therapy (30Gy); Stage IB/IIB receives R-CHOP (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone) for 3-4 cycles plus radiation; Stage III-IV favorable patients receive R-CHOP for 6 cycles while unfavorable patients receive Rituximab. Pre-treatment requirements include ejection fraction assessment, pulmonary function evaluation, Hepatitis B serology, and HIV testing. Contraindications for immunotherapy include active autoimmune disease, primary immune deficiency, immunosuppression, and prior HSCT/solid organ transplant.",
