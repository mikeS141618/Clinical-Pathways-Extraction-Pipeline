==================================================PATHWAY: lung-carcinoids-clinical-pathways-508

Lung carcinoid tumors require chest CT with contrast for initial diagnosis, with DOTA-TATE PET/CT preferred for optimal staging (FBS/FDG PET acceptable if DOTA-TATE unavailable). Disease is classified as localized (resectable Stage I-III) or advanced (unresectable/metastatic, including T4/N2 or T4/N3 disease). No molecular testing is currently required for standard prognostication or therapy selection. For resectable disease, surgical resection with lymph node sampling (minimum >3 mediastinal and ≥1 hilar station) is standard, with assessment of margin status post-surgery. Patients with positive margins require multidisciplinary discussion, while those with Stage II/A/B and negative margins may receive adjuvant platinum-based regimen (2.5 cycles). Non-surgical candidates may receive radiation therapy. For metastatic/unresectable disease, treatment depends on disease burden and symptom status. Asymptomatic patients with low burden may undergo active surveillance or treatment. First-line therapy for symptomatic or higher burden disease is octreotide long-acting release or lanreotide. Upon progression, everolimus is indicated. For progression after everolimus, Dotatate-positive patients receive Lutetium Lu-177 dotatate or capecitabine/temozolomide, while Dotatate-negative patients require DPYD testing before capecitabine/temozolomide. Dotatate-negative disease may indicate more aggressive biology requiring FDG-PET evaluation and possibly cytotoxic chemotherapy. DPYD testing is mandatory before capecitabine therapy, with Pharmacogenomics consultation for intermediate/poor metabolizers. Veterans with typical or atypical carcinoid of the lung who served in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Syria, Uzbekistan (Sept. 19, 2001-present) during Persian Gulf War, or Southwest Asia theater (Aug. 2, 1990-present) qualify for presumptive service connection.

PATHWAY: myelodysplastic-syndromes-clinical-pathways

Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) pathway requires diagnostic confirmation via complete blood count with differential, bone marrow biopsy and aspirate, flow cytometry, iron studies, and karyotype analysis. Diagnostic categories include RA/RS, RCMD, RAEB, CMML, RARS, RCMD-RS, RAEB-t, 5q-, and unclassified MDS. Risk stratification uses IPSS/IPSS-R scoring, categorizing patients as high-risk, low-risk, or isolated anemia. Molecular testing includes bone marrow karyotype, with conditional FISH testing for -5/5q, -7/7q, +8, and del(20q) when karyotype is inadequate. Somatic NGS testing targets specific genes including TP53, KMT2A, FLT3, SF3B1, NPM1, RUNX1, NRAS, ETV6, IDH2, CBL, EZH2, U2AF1, SRSF2, DNMT3A, ASXL1, and KRAS. Transplant eligibility assessment considers age <75 years, ECOG PS 0-1, and comorbidities. High-risk MDS treatment includes allogeneic stem cell transplant for eligible patients or hypomethylating agents (decitabine or azacitidine for 4-6 cycles) for ineligible patients. Low-risk MDS with del(5q) is treated with lenalidomide for 3-4 months. Isolated anemia management depends on serum erythropoietin (sEPO) levels: ESAs for sEPO <500 for 8-12 weeks, alternative approaches for sEPO >500. Ring sideroblast presence guides specific management. Supportive care includes iron chelation for patients with >20 packed RBC units transfused. Response assessment requires regular bone marrow biopsy, peripheral blood counts, and monitoring for progression to AML. VA presumptive service connection applies to Post-9/11 Veterans who served in specific locations and Gulf War Veterans who served in Southwest Asia theater or Somalia.

PATHWAY: glioblastoma-clinical-pathways

Glioblastoma pathway applies to patients with structural imaging (preferably MRI) suspicious for high-grade glioma requiring neurosurgical evaluation for maximal safe resection or stereotactic biopsy if unresectable. Post-surgical MRI within 72 hours assesses resection extent. Molecular testing stratifies patients into standard testing (age >55, non-midline tumor, non-posterior fossa location, no previous low-grade glioma) requiring IDH and ATRX immunohistochemistry, or comprehensive genomic profiling for atypical features (age <55, midline tumor, circumscribed glioma, posterior fossa location, unusual histology, IDH-wildtype with ATRX loss, or IDH-wildtype without glioblastoma-defining alterations). Diagnostic classification follows WHO criteria: IDH-mutant with ATRX loss suggests diffuse astrocytoma; IDH-mutant with retained ATRX requires 1p/19q co-deletion testing (oligodendroglioma if co-deleted); IDH-wildtype with TERT mutation, EGFR amplification, or chromosome 7 gain with chromosome 10 loss confirms glioblastoma. MGMT promoter methylation testing predicts temozolomide response. Treatment depends on Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS): patients with KPS ≥60 receive hypofractionated radiation if ≥70 years or standard radiation with concurrent temozolomide (75 mg/m² daily) if <70 years. Adjuvant temozolomide continues for 6-12 cycles with brain MRI every 2-3 months. Pseudoprogression monitoring is essential within 12 weeks post-radiation. Veterans with brain cancer/glioblastoma may qualify for automatic service connection if exposed to ionizing radiation as Atomic Veterans or served in specific regions (Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Uzbekistan, Yemen, Southwest Asia theater, Somalia) after specified dates (September 11, 2001 or August 2, 1990).

PATHWAY: idh-mutant-astrocytoma-clinical-pathways

IDH Mutant Astrocytoma pathway requires initial intracranial imaging suspicious for glioma followed by maximal safe resection or biopsy with post-resection MRI within 72 hours. Molecular testing includes IDH and ATRX immunohistochemistry, with positive IDH mutation cases requiring FISH testing for 1p/19q codeletion and CDKN2A/B homozygous loss, plus TERT promoter mutation testing. Classification criteria: IDH mutant with ATRX loss indicates Astrocytoma WHO Grade 2; IDH mutant with ATRX retained and 1p/19q intact indicates Astrocytoma WHO Grade 4; IDH mutant with ATRX retained and 1p/19q co-deleted with CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion indicates Oligodendroglioma WHO Grade 3, while intact or single copy deletion indicates Grade 2. Treatment for Grade 2 astrocytoma depends on risk stratification: high-risk features (age >40 with residual tumor, neurologic symptoms, contrast enhancement) require radiation therapy followed by temozolomide or PCV if KPS >60. Grade 3 with KPS ≥70 receives radiation therapy with consideration for adjuvant temozolomide. Grade 4 with KPS ≥70 receives temozolomide 75mg/m²/day for 42 days with concurrent radiation, followed by adjuvant temozolomide 150-200mg/m² days 1-5 of 28-day cycles for 6-12 months if no pseudoprogression. Poor performance status (KPS <70) requires individualized approaches. Surveillance includes MRI 4 weeks post-radiation, then every 3-4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for years 3-5, and annually thereafter. VA presumptive service connection applies to veterans with brain cancer exposed to ionizing radiation or with qualifying service after August 2, 1990 (Southwest Asia, Somalia) or September 11, 2001 (Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Uzbekistan, Yemen).

PATHWAY: meningioma-clinical-pathways

Meningioma diagnosis requires MRI with/without contrast (or CT with contrast if MRI contraindicated) showing characteristic meningioma findings. Neurological examination assesses for increased intracranial pressure symptoms. WHO classification grades meningiomas as Grade 1, 2, or 3, with treatment decisions based on this grading. Simpson Grading System (Grades 1-5) classifies extent of surgical resection, with Grades 1-3 indicating gross total resection and Grades 4-5 indicating subtotal resection. TERT promoter mutation testing is required for all patients regardless of histology. Chromosomal analysis via FISH (preferred) targets CDKN2A/B homozygous loss, or alternatively microarray analysis (Oncoscan FFPE). Treatment involves surgical resection when feasible, followed by post-resection MRI. Grade 1 with residual tumor requires radiation oncology referral; without residual tumor requires MRI surveillance. Grade 2 cases are referred to radiation oncology; those with residual tumor receive adjuvant radiotherapy, while those without residual tumor may choose between adjuvant radiotherapy or MRI surveillance. Grade 3 cases require both radiation oncology referral for radiotherapy and neuro-oncology referral for systemic therapy consideration. Patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 may require genetics referral. Presumptive service connection applies to Atomic Veterans exposed to ionizing radiation, Gulf War Veterans (served on/after August 2, 1990 in Southwest Asia theater or Somalia), and Post-9/11 Veterans (served on/after September 11, 2001 in specified locations including Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Uzbekistan, Yemen). Non-surgical candidates are referred to radiation oncology and neuro-oncology. Monitoring involves regular MRI brain with/without contrast.

PATHWAY: oligodendroglioma-clinical-pathways-508

Oligodendroglioma is defined by IDH mutation with 1p/19q codeletion. Classification includes Grade 2 (IDH-mutated, 1p/19q codeleted, CDKN2A/B intact) and Grade 3 (IDH-mutated, 1p/19q codeleted, with CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion). Diagnosis requires MRI with/without contrast, followed by maximal safe resection or stereotactic biopsy with post-operative MRI within 24-72 hours. Molecular testing includes IHC for IDH1 R132 mutation, ATRX status, 1p/19q FISH for codeletion, and CDKN2A/B testing. For atypical cases, somatic NGS for comprehensive genomic profiling is performed. Treatment for Grade 2 with KPS ≥70 includes radiation therapy, adjuvant temozolomide, or RT followed by adjuvant therapy. High-risk cases receive adjuvant PCV with RT (Procarbazine 60mg/m² days 8-21, CCNU 110mg/m² day 1, Vincristine 1.4mg/m² days 8/29, six cycles every 6 weeks). Grade 3 treatment with KPS ≥70 includes radiation therapy followed by adjuvant PCV (CCNU 90mg/m² day 1, Vincristine 1.5mg/m² day 8, Procarbazine 60mg/m² days 8-21) or temozolomide (75mg/m² during RT, then maintenance). Surveillance for Grade 2 includes MRI every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for years 3-5, then annually; Grade 3 requires MRI every 3 months for 5 years, every 6 months for years 5-10, then annually. Presumptive service connection applies to veterans with documented radiation exposure or service after 9/11/2001 in specified regions or after 8/2/1990 in Southwest Asia theater or Somalia.

PATHWAY: primary-cns-lymphoma-dlbcl-clinical-pathways

Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL) is characterized by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) histology confined to the CNS compartment. Diagnostic confirmation requires brain MRI with and without contrast (or CT with contrast if MRI contraindicated), full body PET/CT to exclude systemic disease, and pathological confirmation via neurosurgical or stereotactic biopsy demonstrating DLBCL. Additional required assessments include complete ophthalmologic examination, CSF analysis with cytology and flow cytometry for large B-cell lymphoma, serum LDH, HIV testing, hepatitis B status, and testicular ultrasound for males >60 years. Treatment eligibility depends on transplant candidacy based on age, performance status, comorbidities, and organ function. Transplant-eligible patients receive induction therapy with MTR (Methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, Temozolomide, Rituximab), R-MPV (Rituximab, Methotrexate, Procarbazine, Vincristine), or MATRix (Methotrexate, Cytarabine, Thiotepa, Rituximab), followed by response assessment via brain MRI and possibly repeat CSF analysis. Complete or partial responders proceed to high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue. Non-transplant candidates receive MTR induction if eligible for high-dose methotrexate. Contraindications for Rituximab include hepatitis B infection, history of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and active fungal infections. Methotrexate dosing requires adjustment based on renal function, with age-adjusted dosing for patients >65 years. PCP prophylaxis is required during high-dose methotrexate induction. Response assessment includes brain MRI evaluation for complete response, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease, which determines subsequent management decisions.

PATHWAY: vestibular-schwannoma-clinical-pathways-508

Vestibular schwannoma is a benign tumor developing on the vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve, requiring brain MRI with dedicated internal auditory canal sequences for diagnosis. Patients are stratified based on neurologic symptom presence and NF2 (Neurofibromatosis type 2) status. NF2-related bilateral schwannomatosis cases require direct referral to Neuro-oncology through National TeleOncology. Symptomatic patients require immediate referrals to Neurosurgery and Radiation Oncology, with Otolaryngology consultation as needed, followed by multidisciplinary treatment planning through local tumor board or National TeleOncology CNS Virtual Tumor Board. Treatment decisions consider tumor size, location, growth rate, and symptom severity. Asymptomatic patients follow a surveillance protocol consisting of annual audiometry and brain MRI for 10 years, transitioning to every 3-5 years if stable. Progression indicators include tumor growth or new hearing loss, triggering specialist referrals. Comprehensive monitoring includes serial MRI with internal auditory canal protocol, audiometric testing, vestibular function assessment, and cranial nerve assessment. The condition is not a VA presumptive condition, requiring standard disability claim processes for service connection. Clinical trial participation should be considered throughout management, with navigation assistance available through CancerClinicalTrialsNavigation@va.gov. Quality metrics include time to specialist evaluation, surveillance protocol adherence, multidisciplinary discussion documentation, and patient-reported outcomes.

PATHWAY: breast-cancer-clinical-pathways

This breast cancer clinical pathway applies to patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer, including DCIS, invasive, and metastatic disease. Eligibility determination requires ER/PR/HER2 status testing, with HER2 positivity defined as IHC 3+ or FISH showing ≥6.0 HER2 signals/cell or ≥4.0 signals with HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2.0. Triple negative disease is defined as ER-/PR-/HER2-. Staging requires TNM classification with specific management for Stage I-III and Stage IV disease. Biomarker testing includes germline BRCA1/2/PALB2 testing, 21-gene RT-PCR assay (Oncotype DX) for ER+/PR+/HER2- disease with scores >25 indicating chemotherapy benefit, PD-L1 CPS scoring for metastatic triple negative disease with CPS ≥10 qualifying for pembrolizumab, and comprehensive genomic profiling for metastatic disease to identify PIK3CA and ESR1 mutations. Treatment algorithms differ by subtype: ER+/PR+/HER2- patients receive endocrine therapy (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, ovarian suppression) with potential CDK4/6 inhibitors (ribociclib, abemaciclib); HER2+ patients receive anti-HER2 therapies (trastuzumab, pertuzumab, T-DM1, T-DXd); triple negative patients receive chemotherapy (dACT, TC, AC-T) with potential immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) or PARP inhibitors (olaparib) for BRCA-positive cases. Neoadjuvant therapy is indicated for locally advanced disease (≥T2 or N+). Surgical approaches include breast conservation (lumpectomy) or mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy or axillary dissection based on nodal status. Radiation therapy follows breast conservation or is indicated for high-risk post-mastectomy cases (≥T3 or ≥N1). The CPS+EG scoring system (0-6) stratifies risk after neoadjuvant therapy. Special considerations include presumptive service connection for veterans with qualifying exposures and specific monitoring requirements for treatment toxicities.

PATHWAY: breast-cancer-risk-reduction-clinical-pathways

This pathway applies to individuals aged ≥35 years with elevated breast cancer risk defined by: Gail Model ≥1.7% 5-year risk, Tyrer-Cuzick >5% 10-year risk, chest radiation exposure before age 30, ADH/ALH (Atypical Ductal/Lobular Hyperplasia), LCIS (Lobular Carcinoma in Situ), or pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline variants. High-risk patients (≥20% lifetime risk) require annual mammogram and MRI. Pharmacologic interventions vary by menopausal status: pre-menopausal women without contraindications receive tamoxifen 20mg daily for 5 years; peri-menopausal women receive tamoxifen 5mg daily for 3 years; post-menopausal women with osteoporosis/osteopenia receive raloxifene 60mg daily for 5 years if no history of DVT/PE/stroke, while those without bone density concerns receive anastrozole. Tamoxifen contraindications include DVT, PE, stroke, hypersensitivity, pregnancy, uterine malignancy, and concomitant warfarin therapy. Specific surveillance protocols exist for genetic variants: BRCA1/2 carriers require annual breast MRI starting age 25, annual mammogram plus MRI age 30-75; PALB2, PTEN, CDH1, and STK11 carriers need annual mammogram and MRI from age 30; TP53 carriers need annual MRI age 20-29, then mammogram plus MRI age 30-75; ATM carriers need annual mammogram from age 40 and consider MRI age 30-35; CHEK2 carriers need mammogram from age 40 and consider MRI age 30-35; NF1 carriers need mammogram from age 30 and MRI age 30-50; BARD1, RAD51C, and RAD51D carriers need mammogram and consider MRI from age 40. Risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) should be discussed with BRCA1/2, PALB2, PTEN, TP53, CDH1, and STK11 carriers. Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) should be considered for BRCA1/2 carriers as it reduces breast cancer risk by ~50% if pre-menopausal.

PATHWAY: esophageal-cancer-clinical-pathways

Esophageal cancer pathway encompasses adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma management across stages. Molecular testing requirements include MSI/MMR status (PCR or IHC), HER2 testing (IHC with FISH reflex if 2+), PD-L1 by CPS, and CLDN18 by IHC (≥75% moderate-to-strong membranous staining) for stage IVB adenocarcinoma; PD-L1 by CPS for stage IVB squamous cell carcinoma. Germline NGS testing indicated for MMR-deficient/MSI-H tumors. Disease staging follows TNM classification: Stage IA (T1aN0M0), Stage I (T1bN0M0), locally advanced (T1N1[IIA] to T1-3N3[IVA]), and metastatic (IVB). High-risk features include lymphovascular invasion, poorly differentiated tumors, tumor size ≥2cm, SM1/SM2 involvement, and positive EMR margins. Treatment pathways vary by histology, stage, and biomarker status: EMR/ESD for Stage IA; surgical resection for Stage I surgical candidates; FLOT4 or mFOLFOX6 preoperatively for surgical adenocarcinoma candidates; carboplatin/paclitaxel with radiation for non-surgical candidates or squamous histology. For metastatic disease, treatment selection depends on MSI status, HER2 status (positive: trastuzumab-based regimens; negative: consider CLDN18.2 status), PD-L1 CPS score (<1, 1-4, ≥5, ≥10), and ECOG status. Key medications include FLOT4, mFOLFOX6, CAPOX, carboplatin, paclitaxel, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, trastuzumab, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan, zolbetuximab, ramucirumab, irinotecan, and docetaxel. DPYD testing required before fluoropyrimidine therapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitor contraindications include active autoimmune disease, primary immune deficiency, concurrent immunosuppression, and prior allogeneic HSCT/solid organ transplant. Trastuzumab requires HER2-positive disease and LVEF ≥50%. Ramucirumab eligibility requires prior fluoropyrimidine/platinum treatment, ECOG PS 0-2, and ANC ≥1500/mm³.

PATHWAY: ampullary-cancer-clinical-pathways

Ampullary cancer pathway requires initial diagnosis via biopsy forceps sampling or EUS with FNA/core biopsy for suspicious lesions. Staging includes contrast-enhanced CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis and EUS assessment. Molecular testing includes DPYD testing before fluoropyrimidine therapy, germline NGS panel (BRCA1/2, ERCC5, MEN1, MSH3, CHEK1, TP53, APC, FANCA, ERBB2, RTEL1, HNF1A, PTCH1, ATM, RAD50, MUTYH, Lynch genes), MMR/MSI testing, and comprehensive genomic profiling for advanced disease. HER2 testing via IHC with FISH for IHC 2+ cases is required. Treatment pathways differ by histological subtype: intestinal (CK20+, CDX2+, MUC1-, CK7-) versus pancreaticobiliary/mixed (MUC1+, CK7+, CDX2-, CK20-). For R0 resected intestinal subtype, mFOLFOX6/CAPOX or fluorouracil/capecitabine is used based on oxaliplatin eligibility (ECOG PS 0-1, no prohibitive neuropathy). For R0 resected pancreaticobiliary/mixed subtype, mFOLFIRINOX (if ECOG PS 0-1, no uncontrolled CAD, no prohibitive neuropathy) or gemcitabine/capecitabine is recommended. For stage IV/unresectable pancreaticobiliary/mixed subtype, first-line options include mFOLFIRINOX or nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine. For stage IV intestinal subtype, mFOLFOX6/CAPOX ± bevacizumab or FOLFIRI ± bevacizumab is used. Second-line treatments include fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki for HER2 IHC 3+, pembrolizumab for dMMR, FOLFIRI ± bevacizumab after oxaliplatin, or mFOLFOX6/CAPOX ± bevacizumab after irinotecan. Bevacizumab requires ECOG PS 0-2, ANC >1500/mm³, and absence of non-healing wounds, recent surgery, bleeding disorders, GI perforation, unstable cardiac conditions, or active cocaine use. Capecitabine is contraindicated with adherence issues, inability to self-report toxicity, or severe renal impairment (CrCl <30ml/min).

PATHWAY: anal-cancer-clinical-pathways

**Anal Cancer Clinical Pathway Summary**

This pathway applies to patients with histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (adenocarcinoma follows rectal cancer pathway). Required staging includes contrast-enhanced CT chest/abdomen and CT/MRI pelvis, with optional PET/CT. Treatment stratification depends on TNM staging: localized disease (well/moderately differentiated T1N0 and select T2N0 tumors amenable to complete excision with 1cm margins without compromising sphincter function) receives surgical excision; locoregional disease (any T, any N, M0 not amenable to local excision) receives concurrent chemoradiation with mitomycin plus fluorouracil or capecitabine; metastatic disease (any T, any N, M1) receives carboplatin and paclitaxel, with nivolumab for progression. DPYD testing is mandatory before fluoropyrimidine therapy for locoregional disease to identify poor metabolizers requiring dose adjustment. Response assessment occurs at 8-12 weeks post-chemoradiation via digital rectal exam, with persistent disease reassessed at 16 weeks and 6 months. Non-responders at 6 months without metastasis are evaluated for abdominoperineal resection (APR). Contraindications for immunotherapy include prior solid organ transplant and uncontrolled autoimmune/inflammatory conditions. Patients with periaortic nodal involvement (M+) without distant organ disease may receive aggressive local treatment with extended radiation fields. Gulf War Veterans who served after August 2, 1990 in Southwest Asia theater or Somalia, and Post-9/11 Veterans who served in specified locations may have presumptive service connection for anal cancer.

PATHWAY: biliary-tract-cancer-clinical-pathways

Biliary tract cancer pathway applies to patients with cholangiocarcinoma (intrahepatic or extrahepatic) or gallbladder cancer. Diagnostic criteria include positive findings on multiphase CT or contrast MRI with MRCP, elevated tumor markers (CEA, CA 19-9, AFP), and abnormal liver function tests. Disease classification follows TNM staging with distinct management for resectable, unresectable, and metastatic disease. For resected disease, risk stratification includes margin status (R1 positive) and lymph node involvement. High-risk patients receive capecitabine (4 months) with chemoradiation or gemcitabine-based chemotherapy with chemoradiation if capecitabine contraindicated (adherence issues, inability to self-report toxicity, CrCl <30 ml/min). Standard-risk patients receive capecitabine (6 months), while T1N0 gallbladder cancers qualify for observation. Unresectable/metastatic first-line treatment includes durvalumab+gemcitabine+cisplatin for immunotherapy candidates (excluding patients with prior solid organ transplant or uncontrolled autoimmune conditions) or gemcitabine+cisplatin alone. Second-line therapy is guided by molecular alterations: pemigatinib for FGFR2 fusion/rearrangement, ivosidenib for IDH-1 mutation, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki for HER2 IHC 3+, dabrafenib+trametinib for BRAF V600E, entrectinib for NTRK fusion, or mFOLFOX6/gemcitabine+cisplatin for no targetable alterations. DPYD testing is required before 5-fluorouracil/capecitabine administration. Molecular testing includes MMR/MSI status for all patients and comprehensive genomic profiling for unresectable/metastatic disease. Transplantation may be considered for unresectable perihilar/hilar cholangiocarcinomas ≤3cm without metastases or nodal disease. Germline testing is indicated for patients <50 years, those with personal history of other cancers, or family history of bile duct cancer.

PATHWAY: colon-cancer-clinical-pathways

Colon cancer pathway requires staging (I-IV) and molecular testing including MMR/MSI status for all patients, with comprehensive genomic profiling for stage IV including RAS, BRAF, HER2, NTRK, and KRAS G12C mutations. DPYD testing is mandatory before fluoropyrimidine therapy. Stage I management involves assessment for high-risk features in malignant polyps (poor differentiation, LVI, submucosal invasion >1mm, positive margins, tumor budding). Stage II requires risk stratification based on obstruction, perforation, differentiation, lymphovascular/perineural invasion, lymph node harvest <12, margin status, and tumor budding. Stage III treatment depends on risk level (T4/N2 vs T1-3/N1) and MMR status. Stage IV management is determined by resectability and molecular profile. For dMMR/MSI-H patients, pembrolizumab is first-line for unresectable disease. For pMMR/MSS patients, treatment options include mFOLFOX6/CAPOX, FOLFIRI with targeted agents based on molecular status: panitumumab for RASwt/BRAFwt left-sided tumors, bevacizumab for RASmut/BRAFwt, encorafenib+panitumumab for BRAF V600E, larotrectinib for NTRK fusions, trastuzumab+pertuzumab for HER2 overexpression/ERBB2 amplification, adagrasib+cetuximab for KRAS G12C mutations, and trifluridine-tipiracil or fruquintinib in later lines. Specific contraindications include oxaliplatin avoidance with neuropathy >grade 1, capecitabine avoidance with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30ml/min), and bevacizumab contraindications including non-healing wounds, recent surgery, bleeding disorders, GI perforation history, unstable cardiac conditions, uncontrolled hypertension, or active cocaine use.

PATHWAY: gastric-cancer-clinical-pathways

Gastric cancer pathway requires initial anatomic location assessment distinguishing GE junction tumors (classified by Siewert system: 1-2 follow esophageal pathways, 3 treated as gastric) from true gastric cancers. Staging includes CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast and/or PET/CT, endoscopic ultrasound for non-metastatic disease, and staging laparoscopy with peritoneal lavage for T3/N+/M0 cases. Molecular testing includes MMR/MSI status for all patients, with HER2 status (IHC with FISH reflex if IHC 2+) and PD-L1 testing (clone 22C3 with CPS score) for advanced disease. Treatment pathways are determined by TNM staging: T1N0M0 may receive EMR/ESD if eligible; T2+ or N+/M0 requires FLOT4 (if ECOG PS 0-1) or mFOLFOX6/CAPOX followed by gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy; unresectable/metastatic disease treatment varies by molecular profile. For MSS HER2+ disease, first-line options include trastuzumab with pembrolizumab plus CAPOX/mFOLFOX6 (if PD-L1 CPS ≥1%) or trastuzumab with chemotherapy alone; second-line includes fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan or paclitaxel+ramucirumab. For MSS HER2- disease, first-line is nivolumab+chemotherapy (if PD-L1 CPS ≥1%) or chemotherapy alone; second-line is paclitaxel+ramucirumab. MSI-H patients receive nivolumab+chemotherapy or pembrolizumab monotherapy. DPYD testing is required before fluoropyrimidine administration. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are contraindicated with active autoimmune disease, primary immune deficiency, concurrent immunosuppression, or prior transplantation. Capecitabine is avoided in patients with medication adherence issues, inability to self-report toxicity, or severe renal impairment (CrCl <30ml/min).

PATHWAY: gastrointestinal-neuroendocrine-tumors-clinical-pathways

Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors (GI-NETs) are classified by differentiation (well-differentiated Grade 1/2 vs. poorly differentiated), functionality (hormone-producing vs. non-functional), anatomic site (gastric, pancreatic, duodenal, midgut, hindgut, appendiceal), and stage (localized vs. metastatic). Diagnostic workup includes multiphasic chest/abdominopelvic CT/MRI, SSTR-PET (DOTATATE/DOTATOC) for well-differentiated NETs, FDG-PET for poorly differentiated NETs, and biochemical assessment for functional tumors. DPYD testing is required before fluoropyrimidine therapy. Type 1 gastric NETs require EGD with biopsies, gastric pH, serum gastrin, and vitamin B12 levels. Type 2 gastric NETs are associated with gastrinoma. Type 3 gastric NETs require EUS assessment. Duodenal, midgut, and hindgut NETs require staging with multiphasic imaging, SSTR-PET, and biochemical testing. Appendiceal NETs management depends on tumor size (>2cm vs ≤2cm), margin status, and lymph node involvement. Treatment for metastatic well-differentiated, non-functional NETs includes surgical resection/debulking when appropriate, octreotide LAR or lanreotide (Ki67 ≤25%), chemotherapy with CAPTEM (for Ki67 >25% or vital organ function threat), Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (if eligible: eGFR >30ml/min, adequate liver function, PT <1.5xULN, Hgb >8g/dL, WBC >2000/μL, platelets >75,000/μL), everolimus (well-controlled/non-diabetic), or sunitinib (poorly controlled diabetes). Functional NETs receive octreotide LAR or lanreotide with telotristat for refractory diarrhea (stool frequency >4 despite optimized therapy). Poorly differentiated NETs receive carboplatin and etoposide, with CAPTEM or FOLFIRI upon progression. Germline NGS panel testing (MEN1, CDKN1B, NF1, TSC1, TSC2, BRCA2, CHEK2, MUTYH, VHL) is indicated for Type 2 gastric NETs, pancreatic NETs, age <50, multifocal disease, or relevant personal/family history.

PATHWAY: hepatocellular-carcinoma-clinical-pathways

Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) pathway requires diagnosis confirmation via LI-RADS 5 in patients with cirrhosis, high HCC risk, or biopsy. Initial assessment includes liver function tests, portal hypertension evaluation, staging with chest CT, multiphase abdominal imaging, and AFP testing. Treatment decisions depend on presence of extrahepatic disease or macrovascular invasion, resectability, transplant candidacy, and eligibility for curative liver therapy. Patients with Child-Pugh A liver function and advanced disease receive first-line treatment with either atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (if eligible for immunotherapy and bevacizumab), durvalumab-tremelimumab (if immunotherapy eligible but bevacizumab contraindicated), or lenvatinib (if immunotherapy contraindicated). Bevacizumab contraindications include non-healing wounds, recent major surgery, bleeding disorders, GI perforation history, unstable cardiac conditions, or active cocaine use. Second-line therapy follows with immunotherapy if prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor use, tyrosine kinase inhibitor if prior immunotherapy, followed by cabozantinib. Curative options include surgical resection, ablative techniques, SBRT, radiation segmentectomy, or liver transplantation for eligible candidates. Liver-directed therapy is considered when curative options aren't feasible. Transplant eligibility requires patient to be ineligible for surgical resection. Special populations include Vietnam veterans with Agent Orange exposure (primary liver cancer covered) and Gulf War/Post-9/11 veterans with service in specified locations (gastrointestinal cancers including liver covered). No molecular testing is required for standard HCC management.

PATHWAY: pancreatic-cancer-clinical-pathways

Pancreatic cancer pathway requires contrast-enhanced CT of chest, abdomen, pelvis with core biopsy of metastatic lesion or EUS with FNA of primary tumor for diagnosis. Disease is categorized as resectable, borderline resectable, locally unresectable (Stage III), or metastatic (Stage IV). Molecular testing includes germline testing (APC, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDK4, CDKN2A, EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, PALB2, STK11, TP53) and somatic testing with comprehensive genomic profiling. MMR protein IHC (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) is required. DPYD testing is mandatory before fluoropyrimidine therapy. Treatment varies by stage: resectable disease receives neoadjuvant mFOLFIRINOX or nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine followed by surgery; borderline resectable receives similar neoadjuvant therapy with reassessment for resectability; unresectable Stage III receives mFOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine-based therapy with possible chemoradiation; Stage IV treatment depends on fitness for combination chemotherapy with mFOLFIRINOX, nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine, or cisplatin+gemcitabine (for BRCA1/2 or PALB2 mutations). Specific molecular subtypes receive targeted therapy: dMMR (pembrolizumab), NTRK fusion (entrectinib), KRAS G12C mutation (adagrasib), BRAF V600E mutations (targeted therapy). Second-line options include mFOLFOX6, FOLFIRI, liposomal irinotecan+5-FU+leucovorin, or gemcitabine-based regimens. Adjuvant therapy post-resection includes 6 months of mFOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine-based therapy. Eligibility for combination chemotherapy requires ECOG PS 0-2, adequate organ function, and ability to maintain oral intake. mFOLFIRINOX eligibility requires ECOG PS 0-1, absence of uncontrolled CAD, and lack of prohibitive neuropathy.

PATHWAY: rectal-cancer-clinical-pathways

Rectal cancer pathway applies to malignancies below the virtual line from sacral promontory to upper pubic symphysis. Initial staging requires rectal protocol MRI (preferred) or EUS for T/N staging, and CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for M staging. MMR/MSI testing is mandatory for all patients, with comprehensive genomic profiling for stage IV disease including RAS, BRAF, HER2 (IHC with FISH reflex if IHC 2+), and NTRK fusion assessment. DPYD testing is required before fluoropyrimidine administration. Stage I management depends on high-risk features (poor differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, submucosal invasion >1mm, tumor at cautery margin, tumor budding). Stage II-III pMMR treatment includes radiation assessment (eligibility: cT1-3N1+ or T3N0, no threatened CRM, tumor >5cm from anal verge). Treatment options include short-course RT, chemoRT with 5-FU/capecitabine, mFOLFOX6/CAPOX, or FOLFRINOX for aggressive disease (T4, N2, involved/threatened CRM, low-lying tumors, extramural venous invasion). Stage IV treatment branches by resectability and MMR status. dMMR/MSI-H patients receive pembrolizumab. pMMR treatment is guided by molecular status: RAS/BRAF wild-type receive mFOLFOX6/CAPOX+panitumumab or FOLFIRI+panitumumab; RAS-mutant receive mFOLFOX6/CAPOX±bevacizumab or FOLFIRI±bevacizumab. Second-line options include encorafenib+panitumumab (BRAF V600E), larotrectinib (NTRK fusion), trastuzumab+pertuzumab (HER2+/RAS/BRAF wild-type), and adagrasib+cetuximab (KRAS G12C). Contraindications exist for oxaliplatin (neuropathy >grade 1, prior treatment within 12 months), capecitabine (CrCl <30ml/min), and bevacizumab (non-healing wounds, recent surgery, bleeding disorders, uncontrolled hypertension, heart failure).

PATHWAY: bladder-cancer-clinical-pathways-508-remediated

Bladder cancer pathway eligibility requires CT urogram, cystoscopy, and TURBT for diagnosis and staging. Patients are stratified into non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) or muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) based on TURBT pathology. NMIBC is classified as Low Risk (papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential or low-grade Ta ≤3cm solitary), Intermediate Risk (low-grade with T1/multifocal/>3cm/recurrence or high-grade Ta <3cm solitary), or High Risk (high-grade with CIS/T1/>3cm/multifocal or variant histologies/LVI/prostatic involvement). MIBC includes Stage II, IIIA, IIIB, IVA, and IVB disease. Treatment for NMIBC varies by risk: Low Risk requires surveillance; Intermediate Risk requires intravesical BCG or gemcitabine; High Risk requires BCG, radical cystectomy, or alternative therapies for BCG-unresponsive disease (gemcitabine/docetaxel, pembrolizumab, nadofaragene firadenovec). MIBC treatment depends on chemotherapy candidacy and includes neoadjuvant gemcitabine/cisplatin/durvalumab followed by radical cystectomy with adjuvant durvalumab, or bladder preservation with 5FU/mitomycin and radiotherapy. Stage IVA treatment options include enfortumab vedotin with pembrolizumab, gemcitabine/cisplatin/nivolumab, or 5FU/mitomycin with radiation. Stage IVB (metastatic) treatment includes enfortumab vedotin with pembrolizumab, carboplatin/gemcitabine with avelumab maintenance, or pembrolizumab monotherapy, with second-line options including erdafitinib for FGFR3 alterations or fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan for HER2 overexpression. Molecular testing for advanced disease includes comprehensive genomic profiling and PD-L1 expression testing. Special scenarios include prostatic urethral involvement and upper GU tract carcinoma. Presumptive service connection applies to Vietnam veterans (Agent Orange exposure), Atomic veterans (radiation exposure), and Gulf War/Post-9/11 veterans with specific deployment locations.

PATHWAY: kidney-cancer-clinical-pathways

The kidney cancer clinical pathway applies to patients with confirmed or suspected renal malignancies requiring CT abdomen/pelvis, chest x-ray, complete metabolic panel, CBC with differential, lactate dehydrogenase, and urinalysis for initial diagnosis. Staging determines treatment: Stage I T1a tumors (≤4cm) warrant active surveillance, partial nephrectomy, radical nephrectomy, or ablative procedures; T1b tumors (>4cm but ≤7cm) require partial/radical nephrectomy with ablative procedures as alternatives. Stage II management involves partial/radical nephrectomy with adjuvant pembrolizumab eligibility for clear cell carcinoma with nuclear grade 4 or sarcomatoid differentiation. Stage III requires radical nephrectomy followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab. Stage IV or relapsed clear cell disease necessitates risk stratification (favorable, intermediate, poor) based on specific factors: time from diagnosis to therapy (<1 year), performance status <80%, abnormal hemoglobin, calcium, neutrophil, and platelet levels. Treatment options include cytoreductive nephrectomy, metastasis-directed therapy, and systemic therapy with ipilimumab+nivolumab (intermediate/poor risk) or pembrolizumab+axitinib (favorable risk), with cabozantinib as second-line therapy. Surveillance protocols vary by stage: Stage I requires annual H&P and CMP for 5 years with periodic imaging; Stages II/III need more frequent monitoring (every 3-6 months for years 1-3); Stage IV requires monitoring every 6-16 weeks during therapy. Gulf War and Post-9/11 Veterans with service in specific regions (Afghanistan, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Uzbekistan, Yemen, Southwest Asia, Somalia) after specified dates may qualify for presumptive service connection. Genetic counseling is indicated for patients with multiple/bilateral masses, family history, or young-onset disease.

PATHWAY: prostate-cancer-clinical-pathways

Prostate cancer pathway eligibility requires PSA testing with referral for PSA >3 or 0.75ng/ml rise over one year. Diagnosis involves DRE, urinalysis, post-void residual, and prostate mpMRI (PI-RADS scoring) followed by targeted biopsy. Risk stratification categories include Very Low (T1c, Grade group 1, PSA <10ng/ml, <3 positive cores, ≤50% cancer per core, PSA density <0.15ng/ml/g), Low (T1-T2a, Grade Group 1, PSA <10ng/ml), Favorable Intermediate (T2b-T2c or Grade Group 2 or PSA 10-20ng/ml, <50% positive cores), Unfavorable Intermediate (multiple risk factors, Grade Group 3, ≥50% positive cores), High (T3a or Grade Group 4-5 or PSA >20ng/ml), Very High (T3b-T4 or primary Gleason pattern 5), Regional (N1, M0), and Metastatic (M1). Treatment pathways vary by risk group and life expectancy, including active surveillance, observation, radiation therapy, radical prostatectomy, and ADT. Advanced disease management includes CSPC M1 (categorized as low-volume: no visceral mets AND ≤4 bone mets, or high-volume: visceral mets OR >4 bone mets) and CRPC (M0 with PSA doubling time assessment, M1 with multiple treatment lines). Molecular testing includes germline testing (BRCA1/2, ATM, CHEK2, EPCAM, HOXB13, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, NBN, TP53) and somatic testing for HRR genes, MSI/dMMR, and TMB. Treatment options include abiraterone, docetaxel, cabazitaxel, Lu177-PSMA, olaparib (for HRRm), pembrolizumab (for MSI-H/dMMR/TMB high), radium 223 (for bone mets), and platinum-based therapy for neuroendocrine components. Biochemical recurrence is defined as PSA >0.2 post-prostatectomy or PSA >2 above nadir post-radiation. Agent Orange exposure qualifies Vietnam veterans for presumptive disability benefits, while Gulf War and Post-9/11 veterans in specific locations qualify for reproductive cancer presumptions.

PATHWAY: uterine-cancer-clinical-pathways-508

This pathway applies to patients with endometrial cancer or endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) confirmed by endometrial biopsy. Initial workup includes CT chest/abdomen/pelvis for high-risk histology (grade 2-3 endometrioid, carcinosarcoma, clear cell, serous, mixed or undifferentiated carcinoma) or prolonged abnormal bleeding. Standard treatment involves total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), and lymph node staging. Stage I endometrioid management follows GOG-99 risk stratification based on grade, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and myometrial invasion depth. High-intermediate risk patients receive vaginal brachytherapy. Stage II endometrioid treatment depends on p53 status: if abnormal, paclitaxel/carboplatin plus radiation; if normal, radiation only. Non-endometrioid cancers require molecular testing for HER2, MMR/MSI, and p53 status. Stage III-IV treatments include paclitaxel/carboplatin with targeted therapy based on biomarkers: trastuzumab for HER2+, pembrolizumab for dMMR/MSI-H, or dostarlimab for carcinosarcoma. Fertility-sparing management is available for grade 1 endometrioid/EIN without myometrial invasion using continuous progesterone therapy (preferably levonorgestrel IUD). Medically inoperable patients with limited disease receive hormone therapy for low-grade endometrioid without invasion, or radiation for higher grades or with invasion. Recurrent disease requires biopsy confirmation, molecular testing, and treatment based on prior therapy. Surveillance protocols vary by risk level, with higher-risk patients (Stage III with gross nodal disease or Stage IV) requiring more intensive monitoring. Germline testing is indicated for dMMR/MSI-H tumors or patients under 50. Immunotherapy eligibility excludes patients with active autoimmune disease, primary immune deficiency, concurrent immunosuppression, or prior transplantation.

PATHWAY: head-and-neck-cancer-clinical-pathways

Head and neck cancer pathway eligibility requires tumor site identification (oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, nasopharynx), TNM staging (T1-4, N0-3, M0-1), and specific biomarker testing. Required molecular testing includes P16 IHC for HPV status in oropharyngeal cancer, ISH for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) and IHC for LMP1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and unknown primary, PD-L1 clone 22C3 with CPS score for metastatic/recurrent disease, and DPYD testing before fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Treatment eligibility depends on ECOG PS 0-1 assessment, cisplatin candidacy, and presence of adverse pathological features (extranodal extension, positive/close margins, pT3-4 tumors, pN2-3 disease, nodal disease in levels IV/V, perineural/perivascular/lymphatic invasion). Treatment modalities include surgical resection with nodal basin dissection, radiation therapy, cisplatin with radiation, cetuximab with radiation, induction chemotherapy, and total or partial laryngectomy. Post-surgical pathways depend on margin status and adverse features. For metastatic/recurrent disease, treatment selection depends on PD-L1 CPS score and platinum eligibility. Special considerations apply to unknown primary tumors requiring HPV/EBV testing, direct laryngoscopy with biopsy, and tonsillectomy. Gulf War and Post 9/11 Veterans with head/neck cancer who served in designated locations during specified periods qualify for presumptive service connection.

PATHWAY: salivary-gland-cancer-clinical-pathways-508

Salivary gland cancer management is stratified by TNM staging (T1-2/N0/M0, T3-4a/N0, T1-4/N+, T4b) and tumor grade (low, intermediate, high). Adenoid cystic carcinoma requires special consideration with extended surveillance beyond 5 years. Primary treatment involves surgical resection of the salivary gland with decisions about neck dissection based on staging. Post-resection management depends on margin status (complete vs. incomplete) and presence of adverse features (neural invasion, multiple positive lymph nodes, extranodal extension, lymphovascular invasion). Radiation therapy is indicated for high/intermediate grade tumors, incomplete resections, or presence of adverse features. For recurrent/metastatic disease, molecular testing is essential, including NGS (preferably Tempus or Foundation Medicine), HER2 testing by IHC with FISH for 2+ results, NTRK gene fusion analysis, MSI status, and Androgen Receptor (AR) testing. Treatment selection for advanced disease is biomarker-driven: HER2-positive patients receive trastuzumab biosimilar, AR-positive receive leuprolide (or abiraterone), MSI-High receive pembrolizumab, and NTRK fusion-positive receive entrectinib. For biomarker-negative disease, adenoid cystic histology is treated with lenvatinib, while other histologies receive cisplatin/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (ECOG 0, requires baseline LVEF assessment) or carboplatin/paclitaxel (ECOG 1-2). Presumptive service connection applies to Atomic Veterans with salivary gland cancer and Gulf War/Post-9/11 Veterans with salivary gland-type tumors of lung and trachea who served in specific locations (Afghanistan, Djibouti, Syria, Uzbekistan, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE, Oman).

PATHWAY: acute-myeloid-leukemia-clinical-pathways

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) pathway requires diagnostic confirmation via flow cytometry, FISH testing for translocations t(8;21), inv(16), t(15;17), BCR-ABL1, and TP53, conventional karyotyping, and molecular testing for FLT3 (ITD and TKD), IDH1/2, NPM1, and CEBPA mutations. Risk stratification depends on cytogenetic findings (favorable, intermediate, poor/adverse) and mutation status. Treatment pathways diverge based on FLT3 mutation status and intensive therapy candidacy. FLT3-mutated AML requires cytarabine+daunorubicin/idarubicin+midostaurin induction followed by HiDAC+midostaurin or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. FLT3 wild-type AML with favorable cytogenetics receives cytarabine+daunorubicin/idarubicin followed by HiDAC or FLAG-IDA. Intermediate cytogenetics cases receive similar induction with consolidation options including HiDAC, FLAG-IDA, or transplant. Poor/adverse cytogenetics cases prioritize transplantation post-induction. Therapy-related AML, MDS-AML, or complex cytogenetics receive CPX-351 (liposomal cytarabine-daunorubicin) or standard "7+3" regimen. Non-intensive candidates receive decitabine+venetoclax, low-dose cytarabine+venetoclax, or azacitidine+venetoclax. Relapsed/refractory disease management depends on prior transplant status and molecular subtype, with targeted therapies for specific mutations: ivosidenib (IDH1), enasidenib (IDH2), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (CD33+), and gilteritinib (FLT3). Response assessment requires bone marrow biopsy with complete remission defined as <5% blasts, no extramedullary disease, ANC >1,000/μL, platelets >100,000/μL, and transfusion independence.

PATHWAY: acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-clinical-pathways

Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) is characterized by t(15;17) translocation resulting in PML-RARA fusion gene. Diagnostic criteria include coagulopathy (low fibrinogen, bleeding manifestations), hypergranular promyelocytes on blood smear, and cytoplasmic inclusions in blast cells. Essential testing includes CBC with differential, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, flow cytometry, FISH for RARA rearrangement, PCR for PML-RARA fusion, and FLT3 mutation analysis. Risk stratification divides patients into high risk (WBC ≥10,000/mm³) or low risk (WBC <10,000/mm³). Treatment requires immediate ATRA initiation upon clinical suspicion before genetic confirmation. Coagulopathy management includes maintaining fibrinogen >150 mg/dL and platelets >50,000/mm³. High-risk patients receive ATRA plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy for induction, while low-risk patients receive ATRA plus arsenic trioxide (ATO). Response assessment occurs when ANC ≥1000/mm³ and platelets ≥100,000/mm³, with bone marrow biopsy to confirm response. High-risk consolidation uses ATRA, arsenic trioxide, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin; low-risk consolidation uses arsenic trioxide plus ATRA. Molecular monitoring via PCR for PML-RARA is required after consolidation. Complications include differentiation syndrome (fever, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural/pericardial effusions, edema, hypotension, renal failure) requiring dexamethasone 10mg IV q6h. ATO toxicity requires EKG monitoring (QTc interval), electrolyte assessment, and glucose monitoring. Relapsed APL treatment depends on prior therapy and time since last treatment. Contraindications include pregnancy for arsenic trioxide. Molecular testing includes cytogenetics, FISH for PML::RARA t(15;17), and testing for FLT3 ITD/TKD, IDH1/2, and NPM1 mutations.

PATHWAY: chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma-clinical-pathways

PATHWAY MATCHING CRITERIA: CLL/SLL

Diagnosis requires FISH analysis (chromosomes 13q, 17p, 11q, 12, t(11;14)), TP53 sequencing, IGHV hypermutation status, and CpG-stimulated karyotyping from bone marrow, lymph node, or peripheral blood. Risk stratification uses CLL/SLL IPI Score with unfavorable risk defined by TP53 deletion/mutation and/or unmutated IGHV. Treatment initiation criteria include Hgb <10 g/dL, platelets <100,000/mm³ (non-immune), B symptoms, or symptomatic adenopathy. First-line options are venetoclax+obinutuzumab (12 cycles) or acalabrutinib (continuous). Relapsed disease requires PET/CT to evaluate transformation and treatment selection based on prior therapy. Post-BTK inhibitor treatment: venetoclax+rituximab (24 cycles); post-venetoclax treatment: acalabrutinib. Multiply relapsed disease requires reassessment of TP53 and IGHV status plus BTK/PLCG2 sequencing. Unfavorable risk patients <65 years may receive allogeneic transplant or CAR T-cell therapy; older patients receive venetoclax+rituximab. Favorable risk patients with prior response >2-3 years receive venetoclax+rituximab or pirtobrutinib; <2-3 years receive pirtobrutinib. Response assessment includes flow cytometry or targeted sequencing with MRD testing. Supportive care includes IVIG for hypogammaglobulinemia, TLS prophylaxis for venetoclax, and HSV/VZV prophylaxis. BTK inhibitors are contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment.

PATHWAY: chronic-myeloid-leukemia-clinical-pathways

Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) pathway requires Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) detection via FISH analysis and BCR-ABL1 fusion gene identification through quantitative PCR. Bone marrow karyotyping is essential for complete diagnosis and phase classification. Disease is categorized into three phases: Chronic Phase (CP) with <10% blasts, Accelerated Phase (AP) with 10-19% blasts or accelerated cytogenetic abnormalities (trisomy 8, isochromosome 17, trisomy 19, complex karyotype), and Blast Phase (BP) with ≥20% blasts or extramedullary myeloid sarcoma. Treatment selection depends on phase classification with imatinib as first-line for CP and dasatinib for AP. Response monitoring requires BCR-ABL1 PCR testing every 3 months with specific response thresholds: optimal response (≤0.1% BCR-ABL1 IS/MR3), provisional sensitive (>0.1-1%), possible resistance (>1-10%), and resistance (>10%) at defined timepoints. Management changes based on BCR-ABL1 levels and kinase domain mutation analysis. T315I mutation requires ponatinib or asciminib. TKI discontinuation eligibility requires ≥3 years continuous therapy, stable MR4 (BCR-ABL1 <0.01% IS) for ≥2 years documented on ≥4 tests performed ≥3 months apart, and no history of advanced CML. Monitoring after discontinuation follows strict protocol with resumption of TKI if MR3 is lost (BCR-ABL1 ≥0.1% IS). Hydroxyurea is used for initial cytoreduction when WBC >50,000/mm³. TKIs are contraindicated during pregnancy. Stem cell transplant evaluation is indicated for patients with inadequate response, resistance to multiple TKIs, or TKI intolerance.

PATHWAY: classic-hodgkin-lymphoma-clinical-pathways

Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) pathway requires histopathologic confirmation and distinction from nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL). Risk stratification for early-stage cHL involves assessment of bulky disease (≥10 cm or ≥33% thorax), extranodal sites, ESR levels (≥50 with B symptoms or ≥30 if asymptomatic), and nodal site count. PET/CT using Deauville criteria (5-point scale) is essential for response evaluation. Stage I-II favorable disease receives ABVD chemotherapy (Doxorubicin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine) for 2 cycles followed by radiation therapy (20Gy) if good response (Deauville 1-3). Stage I-II unfavorable disease requires 4 cycles of ABVD with 30Gy radiation. Stage III-IV treatment depends on ECOG Performance Status, with ECOG 0-2 patients receiving Nivolumab plus AVD (Doxorubicin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine). Relapsed disease management is determined by transplant eligibility and immunotherapy candidacy, with options including Pembrolizumab plus GVD (Gemcitabine, Vinorelbine, Liposomal Doxorubicin), GVD alone, Pembrolizumab monotherapy, Bendamustine (for patients with significant neuropathy), or Brentuximab. NLPHL treatment varies by stage: Stage IA/IIA receives radiation therapy (30Gy); Stage IB/IIB receives R-CHOP (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, Prednisone) for 3-4 cycles plus radiation; Stage III-IV favorable patients receive R-CHOP for 6 cycles while unfavorable patients receive Rituximab. Pre-treatment requirements include ejection fraction assessment, pulmonary function evaluation, Hepatitis B serology, and HIV testing. Contraindications for immunotherapy include active autoimmune disease, primary immune deficiency, immunosuppression, and prior HSCT/solid organ transplant.

**Exclusions:** Double hit/high grade B-cell lymphomas, testicular DLBCL, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, primary CNS lymphoma.

PATHWAY: essential-thrombocytosis-clinical-pathways

Essential Thrombocytosis (ET) diagnosis requires bone marrow biopsy with reticulin stain to distinguish from prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis and document baseline fibrosis. Sequential molecular testing includes JAK2 V617F mutation, followed by CALR and MPL mutation testing if JAK2 negative. Cytogenetic testing and FISH analysis for BCR-ABL1 fusion are needed to exclude CML. Risk stratification categorizes patients as high risk (history of thrombosis at any age or age >60 with JAK2 V617F mutation), intermediate risk (age >60, no JAK2 mutation, no thrombosis history, with cardiovascular risk factors), or low risk (age <60, no thrombosis history, with JAK2 V617F mutation). Treatment includes aspirin 81mg daily for all patients without contraindications, potentially increased to twice daily for microvascular symptoms. Low-risk patients receive observation with monitoring every 1-3 months. High/intermediate risk patients receive hydroxyurea as first-line treatment (contraindicated in pregnancy), with peginterferon alfa-2a as an alternative for child-bearing population. For hydroxyurea intolerance (defined by difficult-to-control thrombocytosis, anemia, fevers, rash, ankle ulcers, vasomotor symptoms, worsening splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, or persistent cytopenia), anagrelide is recommended after baseline cardiac evaluation (contraindicated with hypokalemia, long QT syndrome, or in pregnancy). Hydroxyurea unresponsiveness is managed with combination anagrelide+hydroxyurea. Ruxolitinib serves as third-line therapy for further disease progression or therapy intolerance. Disease progression indicators requiring reassessment include new thrombosis, significant bleeding, or uncontrolled ET-related symptoms.

PATHWAY: follicular-lymphoma-clinical-pathways

Follicular lymphoma (FL) requires excisional lymph node biopsy for diagnosis with grade determination (1-3a follows FL pathway, 3b follows DLBCL pathway). Essential diagnostic workup includes CBC with differential, CMP, uric acid, LDH, hepatitis testing (HBsAg, HBcAb, HBsAb, HCV antibody), HIV testing, and cross-sectional imaging (CT neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis with contrast or FDG-PET/CT). Disease staging determines treatment: limited stage (I or contiguous II) may receive radiation therapy (24-30 Gy) or observation, while advanced stage requires assessment for treatment indications including nodal symptoms, organ dysfunction, B-symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats), cytopenias (Hgb <10 g/dL, platelets <100,000/mm³), or disease progression. First-line therapy for advanced disease includes lenalidomide+rituximab (18 cycles) or bendamustine+obinutuzumab (6 cycles), with optional rituximab maintenance every 8 weeks for 24 months. At first relapse, treatment options depend on prior therapy and include bendamustine+rituximab, lenalidomide+rituximab, PI3K inhibitors (idelalisib, copanlisib, duvelisib), radioimmunotherapy, or EZH2 inhibitors for patients with EZH2 mutations. For multiply relapsed disease, transformation assessment is mandatory; if transformation is absent, treatment depends on prior therapy intensity and whether the lymphoma is unfavorable (defined as relapse after anti-CD20, chemotherapy, and lenalidomide OR progression <24 months from all treatments). Cellular therapy candidates (ECOG 0-1, controlled comorbidities, typically <70 years) may receive stem cell transplant or CAR-T therapy. EZH2 mutation testing is recommended for multiply relapsed FL, with tazemetostat for positive cases and zandelisib+obinutuzumab for negative cases. Non-cellular therapy candidates may receive mosunetuzumab. VA presumptive service connection applies to veterans with radiation exposure or service in Southwest Asia theater (post-1990) or specific Middle Eastern/African locations (post-9/11).

PATHWAY: hairy-cell-leukemia-clinical-pathways

Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) is a rare chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by abnormal B-lymphocytes with "hairy" cytoplasmic projections. Diagnostic criteria include bone marrow with "fried egg" appearance, bland ground-glass chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli, and pale cytoplasm with villous projections. Immunophenotypic profile requires bright CD20/CD22 expression, bright surface immunoglobulin, co-expression of CD11c, CD103, CD25, CD123, Annexin-1 positivity, and weak/patchy cyclin D1 expression. BRAF V600E mutation is pathognomonic for classic HCL. Required baseline testing includes CBC with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, hepatitis B/C serology, HIV testing, and bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry. Treatment is indicated with ANC <1000/mm³, hemoglobin <11 g/dL, platelets <100,000/mm³, constitutional symptoms (weight loss, fever, fatigue, night sweats), or symptomatic splenomegaly. First-line treatment is Cladribine 0.14 mg/kg IV daily for 5 days. For relapsed disease, if initial response lasted >24 months, repeat Cladribine; if <24 months, administer Vemurafenib and Rituximab. Supportive care includes PJP and varicella prophylaxis for 12 months post-Cladribine, frequent CBC monitoring for 6 weeks post-therapy, and screening for secondary malignancies. For Rituximab regimens, hepatitis B testing is required with entecavir prescribed if HBsAg or HBcAb positive. Response to Cladribine may take 6-9 months. WHO classification distinguishes classic HCL (BRAF V600E positive) from Splenic B-cell Lymphoma with prominent nucleoli (previously Hairy Cell Variant, BRAF V600E negative). Veterans with HCL and exposure to ionizing radiation may qualify for presumptive disability benefits.

PATHWAY: mantle-cell-lymphoma-clinical-pathways

Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) diagnosis requires tissue evaluation with immunophenotyping for CD3, CD5, CD20, cyclin D1, SOX11, Ki-67 (prognostic cutoff 30%), TP53 mutation testing, and FISH for t(11;14) IGH::CCND1 and del 17p. Baseline testing includes HIV, Hepatitis B serology, LDH, uric acid, CBC with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, PET scan, bone marrow biopsy, with endoscopy for GI symptoms/anemia and lumbar puncture for CNS symptoms. MCL is classified as indolent (leukemic/non-nodal, Ki-67 <10%, SOX11 negative, CD5+, cyclin D1+) or classical/aggressive (nodal presentation, Ki-67 often >30%, blastoid variant has poor prognosis). Stage I/contiguous Stage II receives bendamustine/rituximab with radiation (30 Gy). For indolent MCL, observation is indicated unless anemia (Hgb <10 g/dL), platelets <100,000/mm³, non-immune cytopenias, B-symptoms, or symptomatic adenopathy develop. Classical/aggressive MCL treatment includes RDHAP/RCHOP (LYMA regimen) or bendamustine/rituximab, followed by rituximab maintenance for responsive disease. Relapsed/refractory MCL options include CAR T-cell therapy, autologous stem cell transplantation, acalabrutinib, or bendamustine/rituximab if prior response >24 months. For covalent BTKi-refractory cases, options include lenalidomide/rituximab, bortezomib/rituximab, or pirtobrutinib. TP53 mutations/del(17p) indicate poor prognosis requiring novel agents. Hepatitis B screening is mandatory before rituximab, with prophylactic entecavir for HBsAg or HBcAb positive patients. Veterans with MCL may qualify for presumptive service connection with documented ionizing radiation exposure or service in specific regions after August 2, 1990 or September 11, 2001.

PATHWAY: marginal-zone-lymphoma-clinical-pathways

Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) pathway applies to patients with confirmed B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma classified as nodal MZL, splenic MZL, or extranodal MZL of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Diagnosis requires excisional biopsy with flow cytometry or IHC showing CD5, CD10, CD103, CD200, CD11c, CD25, CD23, BCL2, BCL6, cyclin D1, and Ki-67 markers. Molecular testing includes FISH for t(11;14) to exclude mantle cell lymphoma, MALT1 break apart, and MYD88 mutation testing to rule out lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Staging requires CT or PET/CT of neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and bone marrow biopsy. Hepatitis B/C screening is mandatory before anti-CD20 therapy. Treatment varies by subtype and stage: Stage I or contiguous Stage II nodal MZL receives ISRT (24 Gy); advanced nodal MZL with symptoms, cytopenias, or progression receives bendamustine-rituximab (6 cycles). Splenic MZL with symptoms or cytopenias receives rituximab (weekly for 4-8 weeks). Localized cutaneous MALT receives radiation (24 Gy); non-cutaneous localized MALT receives radiation (2 Gy × 2); gastric MALT requires H. pylori testing with eradication therapy if positive, or radiation (24 Gy) if negative. Advanced MALT with symptoms receives bendamustine-rituximab. Relapsed/refractory disease management depends on prior therapy: rituximab for prior non-systemic therapy; zandelisib or bendamustine-rituximab for prior anti-CD20 therapy with response ≤2 years; and zandelisib for chemo-immunotherapy with response ≤2 years. Transformation cases may require stem cell transplant or CAR T therapy. Veterans with MZL may qualify for presumptive service connection if exposed to ionizing radiation, Agent Orange, or served in specific post-9/11 locations.

PATHWAY: peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma-clinical-pathways-508

Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma (PTCL) pathway requires excisional biopsy with immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry for diagnosis. Key diagnostic markers include CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8, CD30, and ALK status. PTCL subtypes include PTCL-NOS and ALCL (ALK-positive or ALK-negative). ALCL diagnosis requires assessment of CD30, ALK, and DUSP22 rearrangement (for ALK-negative cases). Required imaging includes PET/CT scan, with cardiac function evaluation via echocardiogram or MUGA (EF >50% considered good). Laboratory testing includes CBC, CMP, LDH, uric acid, phosphorus, Hepatitis B/C, and HIV. First-line treatment for CD30-positive PTCL-NOS is brentuximab vedotin plus CHP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, prednisone); CD30-negative cases receive CHOEP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone). ALCL treatment is brentuximab vedotin plus CHP. Post-treatment pathways vary by ALK status, with ALK-negative without DUSP22 rearrangement cases considered for transplant. Relapsed/refractory treatment options include crizotinib (for ALK-positive ALCL), brentuximab vedotin (if not previously used), pralatrexate, or cell therapy referral for transplant candidates. G-CSF support is recommended for patients ≥65 years, those with pre-existing cytopenias, or bone marrow involvement. Radiation therapy may be used for localized disease or palliative care. Presumptive service connection applies to Veterans with radiation exposure, Agent Orange exposure (Vietnam), or service in Southwest Asia theater, Somalia, or specific post-9/11 locations.

PATHWAY: plasma-cell-disorders-clinical-pathways

The plasma cell disorders pathway covers MGUS, plasmacytoma, smoldering multiple myeloma, multiple myeloma, and AL amyloidosis. Diagnostic workup includes SPEP with IFE, serum free light chain assay, CBC, comprehensive chemistries (creatinine, calcium, albumin, total protein), bone marrow biopsy with FISH analysis (targeting 17p/TP53, del 13, 1q21, 1p, t(11;14), t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20)), flow cytometry, and karyotyping. MGUS is stratified by immunoglobulin type and monoclonal protein levels. Smoldering myeloma criteria include bone marrow plasma cells >20%, monoclonal protein >2 g/dL, and SFLC ratio >20. Multiple myeloma treatment depends on transplant eligibility, with transplant-eligible patients receiving RVd induction, autologous stem cell transplant, and maintenance therapy (lenalidomide ± proteasome inhibitor for high-risk). Non-transplant eligible patients receive DRd or RVCd based on performance status. Second-line therapy is determined by refractoriness to lenalidomide and bortezomib, with options including KPd, RCd, DPd, or DKd. For multiply-relapsed disease, penta-refractory (progression within 6 months on lenalidomide, pomalidomide, bortezomib, carfilzomib, anti-CD38 antibody) or triple-class refractory patients may receive anti-BCMA CAR T-cell therapy or teclistamab. Patients with t(11;14) may receive venetoclax-based therapy. AL amyloidosis requires Congo red staining and mass spectroscopy confirmation, with treatment including daratumumab, cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone, followed by transplant if eligible. Supportive care includes bone protective agents (denosumab/pamidronate), thromboprophylaxis with IMiDs, and antiviral prophylaxis with proteasome inhibitors.

PATHWAY: polycythemia-vera-clinical-pathways

Polycythemia Vera (PV) pathway requires diagnosis via bone marrow biopsy and/or peripheral blood testing, with specific molecular testing for JAK2 V617F mutation with reflex to JAK2 sequencing of exons 12-15. Diagnostic workup includes reticulin staining on bone marrow biopsy, FISH to rule out t(9;22) BCR-ABL1, and bone marrow karyotype. Risk stratification categorizes patients as high risk (age >60 years or history of thrombosis) or low risk (age <60 years and no history of thrombosis). Treatment includes daily aspirin 81mg for all patients without contraindications, with potential increase to twice daily for microvascular symptoms. Low-risk patients receive phlebotomy to maintain hematocrit <45%, while high-risk patients undergo assessment for symptom progression. Disease progression indicators include new thrombosis, thrombocytosis with significant bleeding, uncontrolled PV symptoms (pruritis, erythromelalgia, vasomotor disturbances, splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms), or phlebotomy intolerance. Second-line management for progression includes hydroxyurea with or without phlebotomy. Patients showing progression or intolerance to hydroxyurea should receive ruxolitinib. Progression to myelofibrosis should be suspected with progressive cytopenia, rising white blood cell count, increasing splenomegaly, constitutional symptoms, or leukocytosis, requiring bone marrow biopsy and advanced somatic NGS panel testing for genes including ASXL1, BCOR, BCORL, CBL, CUX1, DNMT3A, ETV6, EZH2, FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, KRAS, NPM1, NRAS, PHF6, RAD21, RUNX1, SF3B1, SMC1A, SMC3, SRSF2, STAG2, TET2, TP53, U2AF1, ZRSR2, JAK2, CALR, MPL, SETBP1, ETNK1, PTPN11, and NF1. Hydroxyurea is contraindicated in pregnant patients or those wishing to become pregnant, with peginterferon alfa-2a as an alternative. Allogeneic bone marrow transplant should be considered for patients <60 years with high-risk disease.

PATHWAY: primary-and-secondary-myelofibrosis-clinical-pathways

Myelofibrosis diagnosis requires peripheral blood smear showing leukoerythroblastic picture, bone marrow biopsy with reticulin stain (possibly trichrome if moderate/marked fibrosis), and bone marrow aspirate with possible "dry tap." Essential molecular testing includes flow cytometry (leukemia/lymphoma panel), FISH for t(9;22) BCR::ABL1, bone marrow karyotype, and NGS panel for mutations in JAK2, CALR, MPL, ASXL1, BCOR, BCORL1, CBL, CUX1, DNMT3A, ETV6, EZH2, FLT3, IDH1/2, KRAS/NRAS, PHF6, RAD21, RUNX1, SF3B1, SMC1A/3, SRSF2, STAG2, TET2, TP53, U2AF1, ZRSR2, SETBP1, ETNK1, PTPN11, and NF1. Risk stratification uses DIPSS+, GIPSS, MIPSS70+ v2.0, or MYSEC. Treatment selection depends on transplant eligibility, symptom status, and blood counts. For symptomatic patients: anemia without splenomegaly (Hgb<10g/dL) receives danazol first-line, then momelotinib if non-responsive; anemia with symptomatic splenomegaly receives momelotinib; severe thrombocytopenia (platelets<50) receives pacritinib; thrombocytopenia (platelets≥50) receives ruxolitinib. Disease progression indicators include enlarging spleen, worsening leukocytosis with blasts, new transfusion dependency, unexplained cytopenia, worsening B symptoms, or clonal evolution. For progressive disease: anemia receives momelotinib (if not previously used) or pacritinib (if momelotinib previously used); progressive splenomegaly with platelets<50K receives pacritinib (if not previously used) or momelotinib (if pacritinib previously used); progressive splenomegaly with platelets≥50K receives ruxolitinib (if not previously used) or fedratinib (if ruxolitinib previously used). AML progression requires transplant referral or AML pathway. JAK inhibitors require 3-6 months before efficacy determination and gradual taper when discontinuing.

PATHWAY: primary-mediastinal-b-cell-lymphoma-clinical-pathways

Primary Mediastinal B-Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) presents with anterior mediastinal mass, with bone marrow involvement rarely observed. Diagnosis requires tissue biopsy with pathology evaluation, Hans algorithm markers (CD10, MUM1, BCL6) for Cell of Origin testing, BCL2 expression assessment, and FISH testing for MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 to exclude high-grade B-cell lymphoma. CD30 testing is needed when considering brentuximab. EBER in-situ hybridization is required. Baseline assessments include CBC, CMP, LDH, uric acid, phosphate, viral screening (Hepatitis B/C, HIV), and cardiac function evaluation (Echocardiogram/MUGA with EF >50% considered good). First-line therapy is DA-REPOCH (Dose-Adjusted Rituximab, Etoposide, Prednisone, Vincristine, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin) for 6 cycles, with ISRT/RT as an alternative for patients unable to tolerate DA-REPOCH. Response assessment uses PET scan with Deauville scoring system (1-5). Deauville 4 responses are common in PMBCL and may not indicate treatment failure. Deauville 5 requires immediate re-biopsy. For relapsed disease confirmed by imaging and biopsy, transplant-eligible patients follow DLBCL Relapsed Second Line pathway with post-transplant RT planning, while non-transplant-eligible patients receive Pembrolizumab. GCSF support is indicated for patients >65 years, with cytopenias at diagnosis, or bone marrow involvement. VZV/HSV prophylaxis is recommended. VA presumptive service connection applies to Atomic Veterans with lymphoma (non-Hodgkin's type), Vietnam Veterans with Agent Orange exposure and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Gulf War/Post-9/11 Veterans with lymphoma of any type who served in specified locations.

PATHWAY: waldenstrom-macroglobulemia-clinical-pathways

Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma (WM/LPL) is diagnosed by the presence of IgM monoclonal gammopathy in serum and bone marrow/lymph node biopsy showing lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltration. MYD88 mutations support but aren't required for diagnosis, while CXCR4 mutations in MYD88-mutated LPL indicate negative prognosis. Required diagnostic testing includes complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic profile, HIV/hepatitis B and C testing, LDH/uric acid levels, CT scans of chest/abdomen/pelvis, quantitative immunoglobulins, and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation. Molecular testing should include targeted sequencing for MYD88 and CXCR4 mutations from bone marrow, lymph node, or blood specimens. Treatment is indicated for patients with anemia, bleeding, hyperviscosity, symptomatic adenopathy/organomegaly, or WM-related peripheral neuropathy. First-line therapy includes rituximab monotherapy for mild anemia (Hgb ≥10 g/dL) or symptomatic cryoglobulinemia, while bendamustine plus rituximab is used for bulky lymphadenopathy, Hgb <10 g/dL, hyperviscosity after plasmapheresis, constitutional symptoms, or IgM-related peripheral neuropathy. Hyperviscosity symptoms require urgent plasmapheresis followed by systemic therapy, with caution using rituximab due to potential IgM flare. For relapsed disease, treatment options include zanubrutinib or bendamustine plus rituximab after prior rituximab therapy; zanubrutinib after prior chemoimmunotherapy; bendamustine plus rituximab after prior BTK inhibitor therapy; and zanubrutinib or bendamustine plus rituximab after prior bortezomib-containing regimens. For multiply relapsed disease refractory to BTK inhibitors, bendamustine, and bortezomib, venetoclax may be considered. Veterans with WM/LPL may qualify for presumptive service connection if they were exposed to ionizing radiation, Agent Orange, or served in specific post-9/11 or Gulf War locations.

PATHWAY: lung-cancer-clinical-pathways

This clinical pathway applies to patients with suspected or confirmed lung cancer, requiring initial assessment with PET/CT for suspicious pulmonary nodules. For diagnosis, EBUS examination of paratracheal/hilar stations with sampling of nodes >0.5cm is performed, with brain MRIs for Stage II and above. The pathway distinguishes between Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC). For NSCLC, management varies by stage: Stage IA requires surgical resection with lymph node sampling; Stage IB requires lobectomy with node sampling; Stages IIA/IIB/IIIA require lobectomy with node sampling plus adjuvant therapy based on histology. Molecular testing is essential, including PD-L1 expression (using 22C3 antibody) and Comprehensive Genomic Profiling for EGFR, ALK, ROS1, RET, MET, BRAF, KRAS, NTRK1/2/3, and HER2 mutations. Treatment decisions depend on specific mutations: EGFR Exon 19 Del/L858R (Osimertinib), EML4-ALK Fusion (Alectinib), KRAS G12C (Sotorasib), MET Exon 14 Skipping (Capmatinib), BRAF V600E (Dabrafenib/trametinib), RET Rearrangement (Selpercatinib), ROS1 Fusion (Entrectinib), and NTRK Fusion (Entrectinib). For metastatic disease without actionable mutations, treatment depends on PD-L1 status: PD-L1 0-49% receives Pembrolizumab/carboplatin/pemetrexed; PD-L1 ≥50% receives Pembrolizumab with or without chemotherapy. For SCLC, treatment differs between Limited Stage (cisplatin/etoposide with concurrent radiation followed by Durvalumab) and Extensive Stage (carboplatin/etoposide with atezolizumab). Relapsed SCLC treatment depends on time to progression: >6 months receives carboplatin/etoposide; <6 months receives Lurbinectedin. Surveillance protocols include CT chest every 6 months for years 1-2 post-surgery, then annually. Special considerations exist for VA Presumptive Service Connection for veterans with Agent Orange exposure, ionizing radiation exposure, or qualifying Gulf War/Post-9/11 service.

PATHWAY: mesothelioma-clinical-pathways

Mesothelioma pathway requires histopathological confirmation with classification into epithelioid, sarcomatoid, or biphasic subtypes. PET/CT imaging is mandatory for all patients. Clinical staging (T1-4, N0-3, M0-1) and ECOG performance status (0-4) assessment determine treatment eligibility. For epithelioid mesothelioma, early stage disease (T1-2, N0, M0) with surgical candidacy may receive pleurodesis followed by pleurectomy if positive, while non-resectable cases receive carboplatin plus pemetrexed for 4 cycles with hemithoracic treatment. Locally advanced epithelioid disease (T3-4 or N1-3, M0) with PS 0-1 receives carboplatin plus pemetrexed for 4 cycles, with or without hemithorax treatment. Metastatic epithelioid disease may qualify for radical pleurectomy if pleura >1cm with local recurrence. For sarcomatoid or biphasic subtypes, first-line treatment is nivolumab plus ipilimumab (maximum 2 years) for PS 0-2, with carboplatin plus pemetrexed upon progression if PS remains 0-2. Hemithorax treatment requires PS 0-2, VATS tolerance, and absence of baseline neuropathy, tinnitus, renal insufficiency, hearing loss, or limited cardiopulmonary function. Pleurodesis candidates must have NO disease, low burden pleural disease, and limited chest wall involvement. Ipilimumab dosing is 1mg/kg every 6 weeks. Alternative therapies when cisplatin is contraindicated include pemetrexed, carboplatin, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, irinotecan, CAP (CYVADIC), weekly MTX or CVD. PS 2+ typically indicates palliative care approach. Comprehensive genomic profiling and PD-L1 expression testing are not routinely recommended, and no molecular testing is currently required for standard prognostication or therapy selection.

PATHWAY: molecular-testing-provisional-recommendations

This pathway outlines molecular testing recommendations for solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. For cervical carcinoma with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic disease, testing includes PD-L1 IHC (clone 22C3 with CPS scoring), MMR protein IHC (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2), and MSI testing by PCR, with reflex MLH1 promoter hypermethylation testing if MLH1/PMS2 loss is detected. Ovarian cancer testing varies by stage and histology: endometrioid Stage I requires MMR/MSI testing; Stages II-IV of all histologies need MMR IHC and comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP). Paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid carcinoma require germline NGS panel testing. Advanced thyroid carcinoma requires CGP. For hematologic malignancies: ALCL requires ALK, CD30, T-cell markers, and PAX5 IHC, with FISH for TP63/DUSP22 rearrangements if ALK-negative. B-ALL/LBL testing includes flow cytometry with MRD capability, FISH for BCR-ABL1 t(9;22), karyotyping, and BCR-ABL1 quantitative PCR. Burkitt lymphoma requires IHC/flow for CD10, CD19, CD20, CD43, BCL2, BCL6, Ki-67, MYC, TdT, and light chains, plus FISH for MYC fusions. CMML/MDS/MPN requires flow cytometry, FISH for BCR-ABL1, karyotyping, and targeted myeloid NGS panel. Eosinophil-related malignancies need flow cytometry, FISH for BCR-ABL1, karyotyping, and reflex testing based on findings. MPAL requires flow cytometry, FISH for BCR-ABL1/KMT2A/-5/5q/-7/7q, karyotyping, rapid molecular tests (FLT3, IDH2, NPM1), and CGP. Systemic mastocytosis testing includes serum tryptase, IHC for CD117/tryptase/CD2/CD25/CD30, flow cytometry, karyotyping, and KIT D816V mutation testing. T-cell/NK-cell malignancies require subtype-specific IHC/flow panels and often T-cell clonality testing.

PATHWAY: bone-sarcoma-clinical-pathways

This bone sarcoma pathway applies to patients with chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, or osteosarcoma confirmed through core needle biopsy with expert pathology review. Initial workup requires X-rays, contrast-enhanced MRI of the primary tumor, and CT chest with contrast. Molecular testing varies by subtype: chondrosarcoma requires DNA/RNA-based genomic profiling for widespread disease; Ewing sarcoma needs FISH or RT-PCR for EWSR1:FLI1 fusion; osteosarcoma requires genomic profiling from non-decalcified tissue in metastatic cases. Chondrosarcoma treatment depends on resectability, with pathology-based classification determining approach (de-differentiated follows osteosarcoma pathway; mesenchymal follows Ewing pathway). For MSI-high/TMB ≥10 recurrent chondrosarcoma, pembrolizumab is indicated; IDH1 mutations warrant ivosidenib. Ewing sarcoma requires VDC/IE chemotherapy (vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide alternating with ifosfamide, etoposide) for 49 weeks, with filgrastim support. Relapsed Ewing cases receive cyclophosphamide/topotecan, followed by regorafenib, then gemcitabine/docetaxel. Osteosarcoma treatment varies by grade: low-grade requires wide excision; high-grade needs neoadjuvant cisplatin/doxorubicin or methotrexate/leucovorin followed by resection. Response assessment uses ≥90% tumor necrosis as threshold for good response. Relapsed osteosarcoma treatment includes etoposide/ifosfamide and regorafenib. Surveillance protocols differ by subtype, with chondrosarcoma requiring CT/MRI of affected area plus CT chest every 6 months for 5 years; Ewing sarcoma needs physical exam, CBC, MRI/CT of primary site, and CT chest every 3 months; osteosarcoma requires X-rays, contrast-enhanced MRI, and CT chest.

PATHWAY: gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-clinical-pathways

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are diagnosed through CT scan and/or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with biopsy, requiring molecular testing for KIT and PDGFRA mutations using tumor tissue. Risk stratification depends on tumor size (cm), mitotic index (per 50 HPFs), and anatomic location (gastric, duodenum, jejunum/ileum, rectum). Specific mutations guide treatment selection: KIT mutations, PDGFRA mutations (particularly D842V), BRAF V600E, NTRK gene fusions, and SDH deficiency. Treatment pathways include surgical resection for localized disease, with adjuvant imatinib for high-risk features post-resection for minimum 3 years. Potentially unresectable disease may receive neoadjuvant imatinib, with higher doses for KIT exon 9 mutations, sunitinib for imatinib intolerance, and avapritinib for PDGFRA D842V mutations. For metastatic disease, first-line treatments vary by mutation: sunitinib for KIT mutations, imatinib for PDGFRA mutations (except D842V), avapritinib for PDGFRA exon 18 D842V mutation, dabrafenib/trametinib for BRAF V600E, entrectinib for NTRK fusions, and sunitinib for SDH-deficient tumors. Second-line options include regorafenib (KIT), avapritinib (PDGFRA), and pazopanib (SDH-deficient), with ripretinib as a subsequent option for KIT mutations. Surveillance for localized disease involves CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast every 6 months for 5 years then annually, while metastatic disease requires imaging every 3-6 months. Small gastric lesions <2cm may be observed rather than immediately resected. Recurrence risk assessment considers tumor size, mitotic index, and anatomic location, with high-risk features warranting adjuvant therapy.

PATHWAY: soft-tissue-sarcoma-clinical-pathways

Soft Tissue Sarcoma pathway applies to patients with mesenchymal tissue malignancies including specific subtypes: Kaposi sarcoma, angiosarcoma, phyllodes tumors, intra-abdominal/retroperitoneal sarcoma, extremity/body wall/head/neck sarcoma, desmoid tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma, and uterine sarcoma. Diagnostic criteria require core needle biopsy with expert pathology review, MRI for extremity locations, CT for thoracic/abdominal sites, and CT chest with contrast for metastasis evaluation. Molecular testing includes somatic NGS and DNA/RNA-based Comprehensive Genomic Profiling via Tempus or Foundation Medicine platforms. Staging follows standard sarcoma classification with treatment differentiated by stage I-IV disease. Biomarkers include cardiac function (EF >55%), TMB ≥10, MSI-H status, and specific genetic alterations (BRCA, NTRK, ALK). Treatment options vary by subtype: Kaposi sarcoma uses liposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or pomalidomide; angiosarcoma employs paclitaxel, liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine/docetaxel, or pembrolizumab; phyllodes tumors require excision with margin assessment; intra-abdominal/retroperitoneal sarcomas use doxorubicin ± ifosfamide, trabectedin, or gemcitabine/docetaxel; extremity sarcomas follow doxorubicin ± ifosfamide and gemcitabine/docetaxel sequence; desmoid tumors may receive sulindac, celecoxib, sorafenib, or ifosfamide; rhabdomyosarcoma uses VAC/IE regimen (vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, etoposide); uterine sarcomas employ histology-specific approaches including doxorubicin/trabectedin, gemcitabine/docetaxel, aromatase inhibitors, or sirolimus. Cardiac monitoring requires echocardiogram every 3 months during anthracycline therapy. Service connection applies to Vietnam Veterans, Atomic Veterans, and specific Gulf War/Post-9/11 Veterans.

PATHWAY: basal-cell-carcinoma-clinical-pathways

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) patients require initial evaluation for candidacy for local therapies (surgical excision, Mohs surgery, topical treatments, radiation therapy) with systemic imaging performed as clinically indicated. No molecular testing is required for standard prognostication or therapy selection. Systemic therapy is indicated for patients deemed not candidates for definitive local medical, surgical, or radiation treatment as determined by multidisciplinary discussion. First-line systemic therapy follows assessment of prior hedgehog inhibitor exposure; patients without prior exposure are evaluated for hedgehog inhibitor therapy eligibility with Vismodegib as the preferred agent. Hedgehog inhibitor exclusion criteria include inability to tolerate oral medication, pregnancy/breastfeeding, and fertility concerns. If ineligible for hedgehog inhibitors, patients are assessed for immunotherapy with Cemiplimab. Immunotherapy exclusion criteria include active autoimmune disease, primary immune deficiency, concurrent immunosuppression (including prednisone equivalent >10mg/day), prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and prior solid organ transplant. For metastatic BCC requiring second-line treatment following progression on first-line therapy, options include: for patients with progression on previous hedgehog inhibitor, PD1/PD-L1 therapy; for patients without prior therapy, either hedgehog inhibitor therapy followed by immunotherapy assessment or a combination approach with hedgehog inhibitor therapy AND PD1/PD-L1 (requiring multidisciplinary discussion). Palliative care should be considered for patients who have progressed on available therapies. Key medications include Vismodegib (oral hedgehog pathway inhibitor) and Cemiplimab (PD-1 inhibitor immunotherapy). Multidisciplinary discussion is indicated for initial determination of local vs. systemic approach, when patients are ineligible for standard therapies, after progression on first-line therapy, when considering combination approaches, for complex cases with comorbidities affecting treatment selection, and when standard therapy options are exhausted.

PATHWAY: malignant-melanoma-clinical-pathways-508

Cutaneous melanoma diagnosis requires Breslow depth assessment with staging (0-IV) determining management. T1a (≤1mm) requires wide local excision with 1cm margins; T1b (≤1mm with ulceration/mitoses) needs excision plus consideration of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB); melanomas >1-2mm require 1-2cm margins plus SLNB; ≥2mm requires 2cm margins plus SLNB. BRAF V600E/K mutation testing is mandatory for Stage III-IV disease. Stage IA/IB (T1a-T2a, N0) requires dermatologic surveillance without routine imaging. Stage IB-IIC (T2b-T4b, N0) may receive adjuvant pembrolizumab for 1 year. Stage III treatment depends on nodal status: SLN+ patients receive pembrolizumab (if immunotherapy eligible) or dabrafenib/trametinib (if BRAF+); clinically positive nodes may receive neoadjuvant nivolumab. Metastatic disease treatment depends on resectability, immunotherapy candidacy, and BRAF status: options include ipilimumab/nivolumab, nivolumab/relatlimab, pembrolizumab, or dabrafenib/trametinib (BRAF+). Special anatomical variants require specific testing: mucosal melanoma needs KIT mutation testing; ocular melanoma requires gene expression profiling and HLA-A*02:01 testing for metastatic disease (tebentafusp-tebn for HLA-A*02:01+ patients). Immunotherapy contraindications include active autoimmune disease, primary immune deficiency, concurrent immunosuppression (prednisone >10mg/day), prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation, or solid organ transplant. Surveillance imaging frequency varies by stage: none for Stage 0-IB; every 3-12 months for Stage IB-IIC for 2 years then every 6-12 months for 3 years; every 6-12 months for Stage IIIA/IIIB; every 3-12 months for Stage IIIC/IIID/IV.

PATHWAY: merkel-cell-carcinoma-clinical-pathways

Merkel Cell Carcinoma pathway requires diagnosis confirmation through biopsy with histopathologic examination showing CK20 positivity and neuroendocrine markers. Clinical staging involves complete skin and lymph node examination plus whole body PET/CT or contrast-enhanced CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis, with head/neck imaging for head/neck primaries and brain MRI for neurologic symptoms. Primary tumor management includes wide local excision with sentinel lymph node biopsy for clinically node-negative disease. High-risk features warranting adjuvant radiation include tumor size >1cm, immunosuppression, and lymphovascular invasion. For node-positive disease, options include completion lymphadenectomy or radiation therapy to nodal basin. Clinically detected nodal disease requires FNA or core biopsy confirmation. In-transit metastases are managed with surgical excision if resectable or radiation if unresectable. Metastatic disease assessment includes CNS evaluation, with immunotherapy contraindications being active autoimmune disease, primary immune deficiency, concurrent immunosuppression (prednisone >10mg/day), prior allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, or solid organ transplant. First-line systemic therapy is pembrolizumab. For progression or immunotherapy-ineligible patients, options include ipilimumab/nivolumab combination or chemotherapy (carboplatin/etoposide, cisplatin/etoposide, cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine, or topotecan). Surveillance includes skin and lymph node exams every 3-6 months for 3 years, then every 3-12 months for years 3-5, with systemic imaging every 3-12 months for high-risk patients. Recurrence management follows pathways based on local, nodal, or distant presentation. Molecular testing is not currently required for treatment selection.

PATHWAY: squamous-cell-carcinoma-clinical-pathways-508

The clinical pathway for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) applies to patients with confirmed SCC diagnosis who are not candidates for definitive local treatment (medical, surgical, or radiation) as determined by multidisciplinary tumor board evaluation. Service-connected presumptive conditions include SCC of the larynx and trachea for veterans with qualifying service history in Afghanistan, Djibouti, Syria, Uzbekistan during Persian Gulf War (Sept. 19, 2001-present) or Southwest Asia theater operations (Aug. 2, 1990-present). First-line treatment follows a decision algorithm starting with immunotherapy candidacy assessment; eligible patients receive Cemiplimab while those with contraindications (active autoimmune disease, primary immune deficiency, concurrent immunosuppression including prednisone >10mg/day, prior allogeneic stem cell/solid organ transplantation) proceed to chemotherapy evaluation. Chemotherapy-eligible patients receive Carboplatin and Paclitaxel, while non-candidates receive Cetuximab. Disease progression assessment evaluates number of sites (≥5 or <5), time to progression, progression rate, and location. Second-line treatment for patients with ≥5 sites of progressive disease depends on prior therapy: patients without prior Cetuximab who are immunotherapy candidates receive Cemiplimab; chemotherapy candidates with no prior carboplatin/paclitaxel receive this regimen; those with prior carboplatin/paclitaxel but no prior Cetuximab receive Cetuximab. Patients with <5 sites of progressive disease are referred to Palliative Care. No molecular testing is currently required for standard prognostication or therapy selection in SCC, with treatment decisions based on conventional clinical and histopathological assessment. Clinical trial eligibility should be assessed at all decision points, with multidisciplinary discussion recommended for complex cases or when standard options are exhausted.
