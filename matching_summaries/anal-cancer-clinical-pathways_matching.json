  "matching_summary": "**Anal Cancer Clinical Pathway Summary**\n\nThis pathway applies to patients with histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (adenocarcinoma follows rectal cancer pathway). Required staging includes contrast-enhanced CT chest/abdomen and CT/MRI pelvis, with optional PET/CT. Treatment stratification depends on TNM staging: localized disease (well/moderately differentiated T1N0 and select T2N0 tumors amenable to complete excision with 1cm margins without compromising sphincter function) receives surgical excision; locoregional disease (any T, any N, M0 not amenable to local excision) receives concurrent chemoradiation with mitomycin plus fluorouracil or capecitabine; metastatic disease (any T, any N, M1) receives carboplatin and paclitaxel, with nivolumab for progression. DPYD testing is mandatory before fluoropyrimidine therapy for locoregional disease to identify poor metabolizers requiring dose adjustment. Response assessment occurs at 8-12 weeks post-chemoradiation via digital rectal exam, with persistent disease reassessed at 16 weeks and 6 months. Non-responders at 6 months without metastasis are evaluated for abdominoperineal resection (APR). Contraindications for immunotherapy include prior solid organ transplant and uncontrolled autoimmune/inflammatory conditions. Patients with periaortic nodal involvement (M+) without distant organ disease may receive aggressive local treatment with extended radiation fields. Gulf War Veterans who served after August 2, 1990 in Southwest Asia theater or Somalia, and Post-9/11 Veterans who served in specified locations may have presumptive service connection for anal cancer.",
