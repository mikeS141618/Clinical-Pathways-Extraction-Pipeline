  "matching_summary": "Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) is characterized by t(15;17) translocation resulting in PML-RARA fusion gene. Diagnostic criteria include coagulopathy (low fibrinogen, bleeding manifestations), hypergranular promyelocytes on blood smear, and cytoplasmic inclusions in blast cells. Essential testing includes CBC with differential, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, bone marrow aspirate/biopsy, flow cytometry, FISH for RARA rearrangement, PCR for PML-RARA fusion, and FLT3 mutation analysis. Risk stratification divides patients into high risk (WBC \u226510,000/mm\u00b3) or low risk (WBC <10,000/mm\u00b3). Treatment requires immediate ATRA initiation upon clinical suspicion before genetic confirmation. Coagulopathy management includes maintaining fibrinogen >150 mg/dL and platelets >50,000/mm\u00b3. High-risk patients receive ATRA plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy for induction, while low-risk patients receive ATRA plus arsenic trioxide (ATO). Response assessment occurs when ANC \u22651000/mm\u00b3 and platelets \u2265100,000/mm\u00b3, with bone marrow biopsy to confirm response. High-risk consolidation uses ATRA, arsenic trioxide, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin; low-risk consolidation uses arsenic trioxide plus ATRA. Molecular monitoring via PCR for PML-RARA is required after consolidation. Complications include differentiation syndrome (fever, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural/pericardial effusions, edema, hypotension, renal failure) requiring dexamethasone 10mg IV q6h. ATO toxicity requires EKG monitoring (QTc interval), electrolyte assessment, and glucose monitoring. Relapsed APL treatment depends on prior therapy and time since last treatment. Contraindications include pregnancy for arsenic trioxide. Molecular testing includes cytogenetics, FISH for PML::RARA t(15;17), and testing for FLT3 ITD/TKD, IDH1/2, and NPM1 mutations.",
